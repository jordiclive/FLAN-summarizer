If you know the distance you drove and how many gallons fit in your tank, you can simply divide the miles by the gas to get your \"miles per gallon,\" or mpg.\n\n\nYou can perform the same calculation with kilometers and liters as well.\nThe best time to record is right after you fill your car with gas.;\n, Newer cars have a trip odometer that you can set to zero at any time. It is usually on the dashboard or center console, with a small button you can hold to reset it to zero. Set it to zero when you fill up the car and check it when you need to fill up again -- this is you mileage since you last bought gas.\n\n\nYour trip odometer will say \"0 miles.\"\nIf you don't have a trip odometer, record the number of miles on your car as \"Starting Mileage.\" For example, if your car has 10,000 miles on it when you fill your tank, write \"10,000.\"\n\n, Before you start filling up your car at the gas station, record the mileage on the odometer as \"Final Mileage.\"\n\n\nIf you do not have a trip odometer, subtract your \"Starting Mileage\" from your current mileage to find out how far your traveled. If your odometer now says 10,250 for example, subtract 10,000. You drove 250 miles on that tank of gas.\n You can perform this calculation no matter how much gas is left in the tank, but the more gas you use the more accurate your reading will be.\n Refill your tank completely and note how many gallons\/liters you needed to fill the tank back up. This is you \"Fuel Usage.\"\n\n\nYou must refill your tank completely for this to work, otherwise you don't know how much gas your car used since your last tank.\n This tells you how many miles you drove per gallon of gas. For example, if you drove 335 miles before refueling, and you filled your car up with 12 gallons of gas, your fuel consumption was 27.9 miles per gallon, or mpg (335 miles \/ 12 gallon = 27.9 mpg).\n\n\nIf you measured in kilometers and liters your answer will be in kilometers per liter (kpl). Many Europeans multiply this answer by 100 to get \"kilometers per 100 liters\" of gas.\nYou have to start from a full tank and return to a full tank to know exactly how much gas your car consumed.\n Terry's odometer reads 23,500 with a full tank. After driving for a few days he needs to buy gas. The odometer reads 23,889, and it takes 12.5 gallons to refill his tank. What was his fuel consumption?\n\n\nFuel Consumption = (Final Mileage - Starting Mileage) \/ Fuel Usage\nFuel Consumption = (23,889mi - 23,500mi) \/ 12.5 gallons\nFuel Consumption = 389mi \/ 12.5 gallons\nFuel Consumption = 31.1 mpg","Know that the equation for fuel consumption is \"Miles Driven divided by Amount of Gas Used.\",\nReset the \"trip odometer\" after you fill up your tank.\nRecord the miles on the trip odometer right before you buy more gas.\nDrive your car until the tank is almost empty.\nRecord the amount of gas you buy in gallons.\nDivide mileage by fuel usage to see your car's fuel consumption.\nPractice calculating with an example.","How to Calculate Fuel Consumption1"],["If you have a great idea already, then build off of that.

By focusing on a Biblical passage or verse, you will improve the Christian content of the song and strengthen its value. This will keep it grounded in truth.\n You can listen to the sermon your preacher gives Sundays, and write about the topic he or she put forward.

Acting completely oblivious of the rules is just downright annoying. Here are some ways to really get under your teacher's skin:\n\n\nWaste class time by asking your teacher things that he clearly told you several times. This works best if you ask him something that is clearly written on the board or on the syllabus.\nIf you missed class, instead of looking at the syllabus or asking a classmate, ask your teacher, \"What did I miss?\"\n\nIf you really want to annoy your teacher, say, \"Did I miss anything?\"\n\n\nWhen your teacher reprimands you for doing something you were instructed not to do, act really oblivious. Say, \"I'm sorry, my last teacher said that was okay!\"\n\n, Absolutely nothing is more annoying than a student who not only doesn't pay attention, but also creates a disturbance and distracts the teacher as well as other students. Here are some ways to create a racket:\n\n\nShow up late--loudly. Run into the classroom loudly and pant, \"Sorry I'm late!\" Huff and puff and drop your things everywhere, creating a noisy mess. When you finally take your seat, repeat your favorite phrase, \"Did I miss anything?\"\nTalk to other students. Actively talk to other students while the teacher is talking, even if they don't want to talk to you. This is especially annoying if you are asking them a question that you should just ask the teacher.\n\nIf you want to reach astronomic levels of annoying-ness, ask your teacher a question, and then talk to your classmates while he or she tries to earnestly answer you. That will go over really well!\n\n\nUse your cell phone throughout class. Let it sit on your desk and vibrate repeatedly. Don't bother putting it on silent. Or you can have an incredibly loud and obnoxious ring tone. Let it ring while your phone is buried deep in your bag so it'll take forever to turn it off. This will surely disrupt the class and will make your classmates crack up! Your teacher will love it.\n All teachers love a student who thinks he knows more than they do. This works particularly well if your teacher is a true expert on a subject and you know absolutely nothing about it. Here are some ways to be a true know-it-all:\n\n\nAfter everything your teacher says, say, \"How can you be so sure?\" If your teacher plays along and tries to explain to you why something is true, grunt or say, \"I guess that makes sense,\" but look obviously unconvinced.\nIf your teacher reprimands you, roll your eyes and sigh. That will work wonders!\nConstantly reference your other teachers, your parents, or even your friends as true expert. After everything your teacher says, say, \"But my dad says...\"\nLet your teacher know if you think you deserved a higher grade on a mediocre assignment. That will earn you lost of brownie points.","Don't follow your teacher's rules or directions.\nDisrupt the classroom.\nBe a know-it-all.","How to Annoy People Around You5"],["The slow soak method is a preferred method of preparing beans if you've set aside enough time to soak overnight. Slow soaking ensures that the final product is fully cooked, not crunchy or underdone.\n\n\nIf you choose the slow soak method, put the beans in a 5 qt. (4.7 l) saucepan and cover them with about 8 cups (about 2 l) of water. Put the lid on the saucepan and allow them to soak overnight in the refrigerator.\n For a faster soak, put the beans and water in a saucepan and bring them to a boil. Allow them to boil for about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat, cover it with a lid and let the beans soak for at least 1 hour.\n If you leave your beans in cool water overnight, expect them to at least double in size.

If you fail to uphold your end of the bargain, then the other party can sue you in court and get money damages.Accordingly, you must follow your obligations in the lease agreement.\n\n\nBefore you can do anything, you should find your copy of the lease. Make sure it is the most recent. If you have had a long-term relationship with the tenant or facility, then you might have multiple contracts.;\n, These provisions will explain how either party can end the lease before the expiration date and the circumstances in which they can terminate the lease. In a long-term contract, there are probably several situations in which either side can end the relationship:The sporting facility was destroyed by natural disasters. If a fire or tornado destroyed the facility, then the tenant is usually given the right to terminate the contract.\nThe facility is condemned by the government. In this situation, the tenant can terminate the contract.\nOne side pays \u201cliquidated damages.\u201d These damages are also called an \u201cearly termination fee.\u201d You can usually end a long-term contract early by paying a lump-sum of money to the other side.\nEither side \u201cdefaults\u201d on its obligations. Both landlords and tenants have obligations, which are called \u201ccovenants\u201d or \u201cagreements\u201d in the lease. A tenant, for example, agrees to pay rent on a regular schedule. If either party fails to uphold its obligations, then the other party can usually terminate after a certain amount of time.\n Not all sporting facility contracts are long-term. For example, you might have rented out an auditorium in order to host a two-day expo. However, if your plans change, then you might need to cancel the event. A short-term contract should have a cancellation provision.\n\n\nCancellation provisions can be pretty strict. For example, the contract might state that you have no right to a refund if you don\u2019t cancel early enough., You should meet with an attorney to discuss your options for ending the contract before the expiration date. Your goal should be to end the contract without inviting a lawsuit. Your lawyer can help you find ways to do that.\n\n\nIf you own a sports team or a facility, then you should have a lawyer as general counsel. Call him or her and schedule a meeting. The lawyer can read the contract and come up with a strategy for making a clean break from the contract.\nIf you don\u2019t have a lawyer, then get referrals from other teams or facility owners in your area. They might have tried to end a sporting facility contract recently and can give you the name of their lawyer.Call the lawyer up and explain your problem. You can then schedule a longer consultation.\n You might not want to pay liquidated damages to end the contract early. Instead, your ideal resolution might be to end the contract without having to pay any money. In this situation, you will have to find a promise the other side has not fulfilled, which is called a \u201cbreach.\u201d Go through the contract cover to cover and identify every promise the other side has made.\n\n\nFor example, the stadium owner probably promises to fix hazards and not to interfere with the tenant\u2019s enjoyment of the property. Failure to fulfill these obligations qualifies as a \u201cbreach\u201d of the contract, which can justify termination.\nThe tenant also makes many promises, such as promising to make rent on schedule and to use the facility for only authorized purposes. If the tenant fails to fulfill these obligations, then it has also breached the contract., Before you can end the contract, you need solid evidence that you have a reason for doing so. This means getting evidence that the other side isn\u2019t fulfilling its obligations under the lease agreement. Gather relevant evidence:\n\n\nHold onto communications with the other side. For example, you might have sent notices that rent is due. Keep copies of these notices, as well as anything the tenant sent in return.\nTake photographs. The landlord might have refused to fix a hazard. You should take photographs of the hazard to serve as proof.\nSave newspaper clippings. The tenant might have used the facility for an unauthorized purpose. Hold onto any newspaper clippings which discuss the event.\n You need to put the other side on notice of how it is not fulfilling its contractual obligations. You can do this by sending a breach of contract notice. Format the notice like a standard business letter.\n\n\nBe sure to include the date near the top of the letter. The date is important.If your contract states that the other side has 30 days to fix a problem, then the date on your letter starts the clock.\n Quote provisions from the lease agreement that the other side has not fulfilled. For example, if the tenant has not paid rent, then quote the rent payment provision.\n\n\nList every breach you can find. Start with the most serious violation and then move down to less serious ones., Here is where things can be difficult. You may want to get out of the contract immediately. However, the lease probably states that the party in breach has a chance to \u201ccure\u201d or fix the violation.Your contract might not let you terminate the lease until 30 days have passed and the other side has made no effort to cure.You should talk with your lawyer about how you want to handle this. If you agreed to give the other side a chance to cure, you are legally bound to that agreement. The other side might quickly fix the problem so that the contract can continue in force.\nA good way to think about the breach of contract notice is that it is an opening move in the negotiation process. You can state, \u201cPlease contact me to discuss how to resolve these issues.\u201d\n\n, Your lease probably states where you should send the notice. Make sure to send it to the correct address and use the method identified in the lease for delivery.If you fail to use the agreed delivery method, then the other side could claim that it hasn\u2019t received proper notice and therefore doesn\u2019t need to fix the problems.\n\n\nIf you mail the letter, then send it certified mail, return receipt requested.\nAlways hold onto a copy of all communications with the other side.\n Negotiating a settlement would allow you to avoid going to trial, which will be more expensive than negotiations.A settlement also provides closure. You could end the contract and then move on. You should only negotiate if you are willing to compromise to reach a resolution.\n\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t negotiate if you are unwilling to compromise. Negotiations will only be successful if you approach them with an open mind and in good faith.\nIf you really don\u2019t want to negotiate, then you should either pay liquidated damages to end the contract early or wait to be sued and defend yourself at trial.\n You need a goal before going into negotiations. For example, if you are the tenant, then your goal might be to get out of the lease and not have to pay anything. This can be your ideal resolution.\n\n\nTo figure out how aggressive you can be during negotiations, you should consider your best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Depending on your evidence, for example, your best alternative could be to pay liquidated damages (if your evidence is weak) or win a lawsuit (if your evidence is strong). The attractiveness of your best alternative can help you decide how aggressive to be in negotiations.\nYou also need to know the absolute minimum you are willing to settle for. For example, you might be willing to settle by paying 33% of what remains on your sports facility contract. This is called your \u201cwalkaway\u201d point.If the other side can\u2019t meet it, then you stop negotiating.\n Negotiations will probably take place at a lawyer\u2019s office. You should let your attorney handle most of the discussions, but be sure to offer your input. Your lawyer can\u2019t accept a settlement offer without your approval, so stay engaged.Don\u2019t expect to finish negotiations all in one meeting. You should continue to meet as long as you feel that you are making progress.\n If you reach an agreement, your lawyers will draft a settlement agreement for each party to sign. The settlement agreement is a new contract between the two parties. If either of you violate it, then you could be sued.\n\n\nFor example, the tenant might agree to pay some money to the landlord. If the tenant refuses, the landlord can go into court with the settlement agreement and sue.\nIf both parties agree to end the contract, then you will sign a \u201cmutual rescission agreement.\u201d This agreement will formally end your relationship., If negotiations fail, then you can simply stop performing under the contract. For example, a tenant could move out and stop paying rent. You would then wait for the landlord to sue you for breach of contract. Your lawyer will help you build your defense for the lawsuit.\n\n\nLawsuits can be drawn-out and time-consuming. In particular, lawsuits involve a fact-finding phase called \u201cdiscovery.\u201d In discovery, you and the other side can request documents from each other and ask each other questions under oath.The discovery phase can often last up to a year.\nAt the trial, each side will present evidence that justifies its actions. If you are trying to end the contract, then you will try to prove that the other side breached the contract first. In effect, you will try to prove that what you stated in your breach of contract notice is true.\nIf you lose at trial, you generally have the ability to bring an appeal.","Find your sporting facility contract.\nRead the termination provisions in a long-term lease.\nFind the cancellation provision in a short-term contract.\nConsult with a lawyer.\nIdentify a breach of the sporting facility contract.\nGather proof of the breach.\nFormat the breach of contract notice.\nIdentify the other side\u2019s breach of the lease.\nTell the other side how to fix the problem.\nMail the notice to the correct address.\nAnalyze whether negotiation is ideal.\nTalk about your negotiations strategy with your lawyer.\nMeet to negotiate with the other side.\nDraft a settlement agreement.\nWait to be sued.","How to End a Sporting Facility Contract"],["While you are on the phone setting up your account the customer care person should then give you a user name, phone number, and a password.

You don't want to hurt your shins more than they already are.;\n, Starting the day you get shin splints, you need to ice your shins. The coolness of the ice will help decrease the inflammation of the muscles in your shins and help alleviate the pain. You should ice them four to six times a day for 15 minutes at a time.\n\n\nMake sure you wrap any ice pack with a cloth or towel. Applying ice directly to your skin can cause frostbite., You need to rest your shins for a few days after your shin splints. You should avoid high impact exercises such as running or jogging. Try exercises such as swimming, spinning, or biking instead. They put much less strain on your shins and will allow them time to heal.\n\n\nYour stretches can be done at any point after you get shin splints. They are considered low impact exercises., One of the major causes of shin splints is improper shoes. You should replace your shoes every three to six months or every 500 miles.

Wrap the exercise band or towel around the arch of the foot on the leg that is straight out. Using the towel or band, pull your foot toward you. Hold for 10\u201315 seconds. Repeat two to three times on each foot.\n\n\nThis can also be used to alleviate shin splints., Sit on the floor near a table or stationary object. Using a resistance band, wrap the band around the stable surface, such as a table leg. Loop the other side of the resistance band around the top of one of your feet. Once it is looped, pull your foot toward your knee, pulling against the resistance band. Hold for 10\u201315 seconds. Do 10\u201315 reps on one leg. Change feet and repeat the reps. Do three sets in all.\n\n\nThis exercise strengthens your lower leg and helps reduce the recurrence of shin splints.\nYou can increase your strength by using heavier resistance bands or increasing to 20-30 reps., Stand with your heel together and toes pointed out. Slowly raise up onto your toes. After a few seconds, slowly lower yourself back down. Repeat 10\u201315 times. This exercise strengthens your calf muscles and helps promote balance.\n\n\nYou can perform another kind of calf raise to strengthen a different set of calf muscles. Start with your big toes touching and your heels far apart. Slowly raise up onto your toes as high as you can go. After a few seconds, lower yourself back down. Repeat 10\u201315 times., Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Start walking across the floor, using just your heels to stand on. Continue this for 30 seconds.

Imitation products are less likely to seize (turn gritty) than real chocolate. Experts tend to back real chocolate in terms of taste, but some brands of imitation chocolate compete well in blind taste tests.Use freshly purchased chocolate. Chocolate suffers in flavor and texture when stored too long, especially if it's the real deal.\nFor detailed chocolate artwork, use a thin dipping or coating chocolate.;\n, Even a drop of water can turn your melted chocolate into a gritty mess. For best results, buy powder or oil-based food coloring from a specialty baking store or online.You can use the instructions below with regular liquid food coloring, but the process is much more difficult.\n\n\nOil-based food coloring is best used for light colors, since too much of the coloring can add a bitter taste and stain mouths.These food dyes are more concentrated than liquid dyes. They will stain clothing, skin, and countertops.\n As though keeping the chocolate dry weren't difficult enough, chocolate can also seize if the food coloring is a different temperature than the chocolate. If you are using oil-based food coloring, raise it above room temperature first.(Keep other types at room temperature.)\n\n\nPlace the closed bottle in a zip-locked bag. Remove as much air from the bag as you can, then seal tightly.\nSubmerge the bag in a bowl of warm water for 10\u201315 minutes. The water should feel comfortably warm to the touch, not scalding.\nShake the bottle once or twice during the process to distribute heat evenly. Replace water if it has cooled to room temperature.\nRemove the bottle from the bag and dry it thoroughly.\n If you do not have a double boiler make one from a large pan, plus a heatproof mixing bowl or small pan that can sit atop the larger one. Start with just the large pan, uncovered. Heat 1\u20133 inches (2.5\u20137.5 cm) of water until it reaches a low simmer.\n\n\nDry the top container and a stirring utensil thoroughly while you wait, even if they don't look wet. A rubber or silicone stirrer is ideal, since wooden spoons may contain absorbed moisture., The timing depends on which type of food coloring you are using. Read the full instructions below before you start, since you may need to change the order of the steps:\n\n\nAdd powdered dye as soon as the chocolate starts to melt.You can add oil-based dye after the chocolate melts, as long as you warmed the dye as described above.\nLiquid dye is less likely to cause seizing if added right away, before the chocolate melts.(This is why there is no need to warm the dye in advance.)\n\n, Put the chocolate into the top portion of the double boiler, which should still be at room temperature. Place this container on top of the simmering pan. The indirect heat from the steam will warm the chocolate slowly, keeping it below seizing temperature.\n\n\nIf using a chocolate bar, break it into small pieces of roughly equal size.\nMake sure your hands are completely dry. Any moisture could ruin your chocolate.\nIf using chocolate with real cocoa butter, you may set aside 1\/3 of the chocolate for later use. This is only necessary if you want your chocolates to look glossy.\n White chocolate burns very easily, and should never get above 115\u00baF (46\u00baC).Keep the heat on the lowest setting, or turn it off completely if melting a small batch of chocolate. Stir slowly and constantly until smooth, then remove from heat.\n\n\nIf the instructions above call for adding the dye before the chocolate is melted, see below for more information.\nIf melting a large batch of chocolate (several pounds or kilos), a chocolate thermometer or an instant-read thermometer with 1 degree increments is highly recommended.Keep the chocolate between 100 and 110\u00baF (37\u201343\u00baC)., Most powdered and oil-based food dyes are more concentrated than the common liquid type. Add in small increments and stir in thoroughly before deciding whether to add more.\n\n\nShake bottled food coloring well before adding.\nIf the chocolate seizes (turns gritty), remove it from heat and stir in a neutral-flavored vegetable oil a spoonful at a time. The chocolate will usually smooth out again, but this can affect the flavor., If your white chocolate contains real cocoa butter, it may end up dull and slightly soft after melting and setting. This doesn't affect the taste, but you can restore the gloss if you like by \"tempering\" the chocolate. There are many ways to do this. Here's a common approach that doesn't require any extra equipment except an accurate thermometer:Remove the chocolate from heat and wrap a towel around the base to keep it warm.\nAdd chopped, unmelted chocolate until you have a ratio of 1 part unmelted chocolate to 2 parts melted.\nStir constantly until the chocolate reaches 80\u201382\u00baF (27\u201328\u00baC), and all the chocolate has melted.\n Many chocolatiers cool their chocolate slowly at room temperature, so it is less likely to crack or sweat. Others prefer to let it set in the refrigerator for 10\u201320 minutes, which may work better if your kitchen is warm or humid.Store your finished chocolate in a cool, dry room away from light.\n\n\nFor best results, place paper towels in your refrigerator to absorb moisture.\nIf you are pouring chocolate into molds or using it as a dip, keep it warm until you've finished working with it.","Choose a white chocolate.\nPick your food coloring.\nWarm oil-based coloring in advance.\nBring a double boiler to a simmer.\nDecide when to add the food coloring.\nPlace the chocolate in the smaller container.\nStir until melted.\nAdd the dye slowly.\nTemper the chocolate (optional).\nLet the chocolate set.","How to Color White Chocolate"],["In legal citation terminology, the \u201creporter\u201d is the volume of books in which the court decision is printed.

You will need to get used to some of the most common ones, and be able to look up the rest.For the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, the reporters will be either the official United States Reporter, abbreviated as U.S.; the Supreme Court Reporter, abbreviated as S.Ct.; or the Lawyer\u2019s Edition reporter, abbreviated as L.Ed. In most law libraries, these volumes will generally appear near each other.\nFor decisions from lower federal courts, including the Circuit Courts of Appeal and some Federal District Courts, the reporters will likely be the Federal Reporter, abbreviated F., or F.2d or F.3rd, or the Federal Supplement Reporter, abbreviated F.Supp.\nFor decisions of the highest court of most states, the reporter will often be some abbreviation of the state\u2019s name. For example, the reporter for the highest court in Massachusetts is Mass.; the reporter for the highest court in New York is N.Y.S.; the reporter for the highest court in California is Cal.;\n, Some reporters have reached the point where they decided to start their numbering system over again. In these cases, they start a new series of volumes and call it the \u201c2nd Series\u201d or \u201c3rd Series\u201d or even \u201c4th Series.\u201d The reference to \u201c2nd,\u201d \u201c3rd,\u201d or \u201c4th,\u201d as appropriate, will appear immediately following the abbreviation of the name of the reporter.For example, the highest court in California is up to the 4th Series, so the reporter name will appear as \u201cCal.,\u201d \u201cCal. 2nd,\u201d \u201cCal. 3rd,\u201d or \u201cCal. 4th.\u201d You must make note of the proper series number, if there is one, or you will find the wrong information.\n The number that leads off the legal citation is the volume number within the named reporter.For example, if you have a legal citation of \u201c384 U.S. 436,\u201d the number 384 tells you that you want volume 384 of the United States Reporter.\nIf you have a citation of \u201c42 Cal. 4th 254,\u201d the number 42 tells you that you want volume 42 of the 4th Series of the California Reporter.\n The page number will be the number that immediately follows the reporter abbreviation. If there is a series reference, then the page number will immediately follow the series reference.For example, in the citation \u201c384 U.S. 436,\u201d you are looking for a case that begins on page 436 in volume 384 of the United States Reporter.\nIn the citation \u201c42 Cal. 4th 254,\u201d you are looking for a case that begins on page 254 of volume 42 of the 4th Series of the California Reporter.\n Sometimes, a legal citation to a court decision will include an extra number at the end, separated by a comma. This is a reference to a page within the written decision, leading you directly to the page where a quotation or reference can be found.For example, if your citation reads \u201c384 U.S. 436, 440,\u201d the specific quotation or reference you are looking for will appear on page 440. The decision actually began on page 436 of volume 384 of the U.S. Reporter.\nIf your citation reads \u201c42 Cal. 4th 254, 260,\u201d the specific quotation or reference you are looking for will begin on page 260, of a case that began on page 254 of volume 42 of the 4th Series of the California Reporter.\n Some states do not have a reporter designated to that state alone. For those states, the written decisions of the state\u2019s highest court, as well as some lower courts, will be printed in what is called a regional reporter. This is a series of books that cover a region of the United States. There are seven different regional reporters.The Atlantic Reporter and Atlantic Reporter 2nd and 3rd Series are abbreviated A., A.2nd, and A3rd, respectively, and include decisions from Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont.The Northeastern Reporter and Northeastern Reporter 2nd Series are abbreviated N.E. and N.E.2nd, respectively, and include decisions from Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio.The Northwestern Reporter and Northwestern Reporter 2nd Series are abbreviated N.W. and N.W.2nd, respectively, and include decisions from Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin.The Pacific Reporter and Pacific Reporter 2nd and 3rd Series are abbreviated P., P.2nd, and P.3rd, respectively, and include decisions from Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming.The Southeastern Reporter and Southeastern Reporter 2nd Series are abbreviated S.E. and S.E.2nd, respectively, and include decisions from Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia.The Southwestern Reporter and Southwestern Reporter 2nd and 3rd Series are abbreviated S.W., S.W.2nd, and S.W.3rd, respectively, and include decisions from Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas.The Southern Reporter and Southern Reporter 2nd and 3rd Series are abbreviated So., So.2nd, and So.3rd, respectively, and include decisions from Alabama.

The actual printing date of the book in which the case appears is considered irrelevant for most uses.\n\n\nAn example is the case of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). This case is often referred to even today, but regardless of what current publication may print a reference to it, the date is always 1966, which is when it was decided.\n When you are reading citation references to individual laws or statutes that have been passed by the U.S. Congress, you will look for the abbreviation U.S.C.\n Each state will have its own name for its set of laws. Some states will have more than one, with a separate code for separate types of laws.\n\n\nFor example, the laws of the state of Maryland are reported in the Maryland Code Annotated, which is abbreviated Md. Code Ann.\nThe laws of the state of Missouri are reported in the Missouri Revised Statutes, which is abbreviated Mo. Rev. Stat.\n Most sets of statutes are subdivided by topic or category. These subdivisions are usually referred to as either \u201cTitles\u201d or \u201cchapters.\u201d Some states may use other designations.\n\n\nThe United States Code is subdivided into Titles, which are arranged by subject. The first number in a citation to the U.S. Code is the title number. For example, a reference to 20 U.S.C. \u00a71681 refers to Title 20 of the United States Code.\nIn Massachusetts, the laws are subdivided into chapters, so you may have a reference to M.G.L. (Massachusetts General Laws), c.209, sec. 12. This will be chapter 209.\n Usually the final number in the statutory citation will be the specific section number for the law that is being referenced.\n\n\nFor the U.S.Code, the citation will look like, 20 U.S.C. \u00a71681. The \u00a7 symbol stands for the word \u201csection.\u201d In this case, it indicates that you are looking for section 1681 within title 20 of the U.S. Code., Some states will have only a section number, which may be divided into multiple parts.

If you are able, adjust the brightness settings of available light sources. For example, change the type of bulb in your office or home to a lower wattage.\n\n\nIt may be difficult to change the lighting in your office so it is best to consult your immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department before attempting to make any changes yourself.\nIf you are squinting when reading an electronic device, check the settings if it is possible to adjust the brightness settings. For example, televisions and mobile phones can easily be adjusted within the settings menu.\n The most common reason for squinting is due to the brightness of the sunshine. If you are squinting outside on a bright sunny day, a pair of quality sunglasses may solve or reduce the problem. Research what brands offer as some brands focus on fashion while others on function.\n\n\nMake sure the glasses block at least 99% of ultraviolet (UV) rays.\nBudget how much you are willing to spend on sunglasses as some can reach upwards of $500. If you are liable to lose them, think about choosing a pair of sunglasses that fit within your means.\nIf you are more active, choose a pair of sunglasses that won\u2019t fly off your face easily. You can also purchase accessories to keep them in place or to turn your everyday glasses into sunglasses by simply clipping onto the frame.\n The brim of a hat or visor provides temporary shade by cutting the amount of light entering into your eyes. Choose a hat or visor that\u2019s comfortable and suits your style. A baggy hat may fly off when windy; in contrast, a hat that is too small may cut off circulation and cause you discomfort.\n\n\nMany hats can be adjusted or come in different sizes. Make sure you choose one right for your head shape.\nSome athletic hats are made of breathable material that wicks sweat away from the body, which may be a wise choice for humid climates or if you are prone to sweating a lot.\n Many individuals who play sports outdoors or under bright stadium lights use eye black to reduce glare. Apply black strips or black grease underneath each eye to help reduce squinting. Be careful when using grease and make sure not to let it stain clothes or furniture as it may be hard to clean.Football players and baseball players famously apply this under their eyes so watch a game or research pictures for the correct way to apply eye black.","Adjust the light of the room.\nWear sunglasses.\nWear a hat or visor.\nUse eye black.","How to Stop Squinting2"],["Chinese bonds, especially corporate bonds, can be a lucrative investment for a savvy investor. However, market involvement by foreign parties is limited by the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program. This program sets an upper limit for investment by foreign investors.Some trading platforms or banks may be able to get you in to the market, but check with them first to see if they offer this service.\n\n\nAlso available are the so-called \"panda bonds,\" which are bonds denominated in Chinese currency but sold by non-Chinese companies. The issuers of the bonds are typically more familiar outside of China, so investors looking for greater certainty may want to turn to these bonds., Chinese corporate bonds are those sold by Chinese companies. Like other corporate bonds, they typically carry a higher interest rate than government bonds, due to their higher perceived risk. The Chinese market recently opened access to small and medium company bond offerings, giving investors a chance to invest in these even riskier, higher-returning bonds.Remember to thoroughly research any investment, especially in risky corporate bonds, and assess your risk tolerance before investing.\nThe market for Chinese debt issued on the mainland is generally restricted to institutions and may bar individuals from investing. Investors barred from entering the market can instead invest in what are known as \"dim sum bonds.\" These Yuan-denominated bonds are issued in Hong-Kong and are more readily available to foreign investors., Chinese government bonds are those issued directly by the Chinese government. These bonds are issued in Chinese Yuan, rather than USD, so foreign exchange risk must be considered. As of late 2015, these bonds were only available in the United Kingdom, so check with your broker before investigating this investment further., These funds invest in a variety of emerging market bonds, including both government and corporate bonds. Each individual fund also varies in its geographical focus, but all focus mainly on countries outside of North America and Europe. Investing in bond funds allows the investor to usually experience less risk than they would have if they simply invested in foreign bonds themselves. However, there is significant risk associated with these bond funds as well.Be sure to choose a fund that is the right mix of high returns and lower risk. Analyze several different funds and consider the tradeoffs between them.\n Like many emerging economies, China's economy has yet to become as stable as a developed economy, like that of the United States. This means that economic factors that influence security prices, like interest rates and government regulations, can change dramatically in short periods of time. This can have dramatic effects on your portfolio's returns. Additionally, buying many of these investments in the Yuan opens you up to foreign exchange risk if the value of the Yuan drops relative to the US Dollar.

You all may benefit from relying on each other a little and supporting each other during this difficult time.\nYou may encounter some difficulty in getting information about your sailor from the Navy, if you are not married. Therefore, sticking close to his family can be a good source of information that you may not have easy access to yet.\n The group of people who are most likely to really understand what you are going though are other Navy girlfriends. Find an online community or a local community; if it is available where you live. As you make contacts and make friends, utilize these new friends for support. They may have some advice, or are having the same worries and fears you are.

However, it's important to accept responsibility if you\u2019ve done something wrong. A common response to humiliation is to deny responsibility and push the problem on to others.Don\u2019t let this defensive move prevent you from facing yourself and pushing through to the other side.\n\n\nApologize for your actions if you've made a mistake, like an error at work that causes a lot of problems.;\n, A lot of humiliation comes from something called \u2018\u2019performance expectation.\u2019\u2019 This refers to expectations placed on your ability to perform a certain task well. The higher the performance expectation, the more harshly you can be judged for failing to accomplish the task.Having a healthy sense of performance expectation is important. Failure is part of the learning process, so don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself, and don\u2019t allow other people to pressure you either.\n It\u2019s important to be resilient and forgive yourself when you mess up. Feeling bad about our actions can help us discover insight into problems with our behavior, but you can keep the insight and drop the humiliation. Ask yourself if you would repeat your actions a second time around. If you wouldn\u2019t, then that points to the fact that you are genuinely remorseful.Tell yourself that making mistakes is human and you're trying your best to do the right thing.\n Some people have called our time the \u201cage of humiliation.\u201dBeing humiliated is a common occurrence for a lot of people, especially with the popularity of the internet, where the intimate details of our lives can show up on public places like social media websites. Humiliation is a widespread phenomenon, although this shouldn\u2019t minimize your feelings or the uniqueness of your situation.\n If the humiliating experience is lingering in your mind and causing you a lot of pain, use principles and techniques from mindfulness meditation to help you let go of the emotional wound and move on with your life.Frequently, a painful emotion or memory keeps us feeling hurt because we are avoiding its expression. Practice facing your emotions without running or shrinking away. Think of the emotion like a wave that comes and goes. Try to observe the wave without interfering with the way it moves. This will help you create distance between yourself and the emotion without denying it.\n Sometimes protecting yourself from humiliation is as simple as figuring out which situations and people are likely to humiliate you. Identify these triggers for humiliation and extinguish them from your life. This could be an overly negative friend who always puts you down, a demoralizing workplace that is never happy with your contributions, or a family that tries to shame you at every turn.\n Humility is about learning to accept and realistically assess your strengths and limitations. Being realistic about your character is a great way to protect yourself from humiliation, which tries to degrade you. A person with humility won\u2019t fall victim to the illusion of worthlessness that humiliating experiences try to push on us.Make a list of your strengths and challenges. Have a close friend or loved one look over the list and discuss it with you. Ask for the person\u2019s honest opinion and try to be receptive to his feedback.\n Research shows that self-esteem can be a powerful defense against the humiliation associated with failure.Follow these steps to increase your self-esteem:\n\n\nAvoid comparing yourself to other people. Your only competition should be with yourself. The reason you should avoid doing this is because you don\u2019t see what goes on behind the scenes in the lives of other people. You may be comparing yourself to the way they are presenting themselves rather than their true identity.Adjust your self-talk. Replace negative thoughts like \u201cI can\u2019t do it\u201d with hopeful statements such as \u201cthis is hard, but I can get through it.\u201d Avoid putting unreasonable demands on yourself with thoughts about what you \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cmust\u201d do.\n Certain mental health conditions can make you more vulnerable to humiliation. Social phobia, narcissistic personality disorder, and major depression can leave you open to the experience of humiliation more than people who don\u2019t struggle from these hardships.If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with any of these disorders, seek help in order to vaccinate yourself against humiliation before it happens.\n\n\nSocial phobia is a strong fear of being judged by others, with symptoms like anxiety around people, feeling self-conscious, and having a hard time meeting people.Narcissistic personality disorder is marked by having a tendency to hold an unrealistic view of self-importance (such as thinking you're the best cook in the entire world even though you have never attended cooking school and have no practice in cooking), being preoccupied with yourself, and lacking empathy for others.Major depression shows up as sustained feelings of sadness, frustration, and other negative emotions for weeks at a time, interfering with daily life., If you have a hard time forgetting about the humiliating experience, use techniques like attention shifting, relaxation, and repeated exposure to help you move past the memory., Attention shifting is where you use a particular phrase or action to help you deal with the memory, such as thinking \"this is just one experience in my entire life\" whenever it comes up. Attention shifting has been shown to help reduce anxiety in situations, because it allows you to freely choose what you pay attention to, rather than being compelled to focus on negative thoughts and feelings.Whenever the humiliating memory pops up, say to yourself, \"everyone feels humiliated at some point in their life. I know I can recover from this experience.\"\n\n, Progressive muscle relaxation is where you tense and then relax your muscles one area at a time. Start with your toes, curling them downward. Do this for a couple seconds and release. Next, tense your foot and lower leg. Keep doing this, moving up your body all the way to your forehead.\n\n\nYou can try other methods as well, such as guided imagery. Picture one of your favorite places to be when the humiliating experience starts to bother you. This could be your living room with candles lit, a football field, or a sunny beach.Keeping yourself relaxed will reduce the likelihood that you dwell on the humiliating experience. It will also help you process and cope with the humiliating experience when it does come up in your memory. Usually, this memory will show up with a lot of anxiety. Relaxation techniques will help you reduce this anxiety and extinguish the memory., Repeated exposure is a technique for exposing yourself to situations so that you gradually begin to realize they aren't that dangerous. You can do this with the humiliating experience, for example, if it happened on a stage at your school, or in a specific room of your house. Spend time in these places and let the panic or discomfort subside.\n\n\nThis kind of exposure therapy requires that you spend enough time in the stressful environment for your mind to adapt to the fact that there's no danger present. If you walk into the room where you were humiliated, start to feel upset, and quickly leave, then the exposure likely won't have an effect. Try to enter the room or face the situation and let yourself slowly relax into your body. Deep, even breathing can help you calm down and accept where you are., The first step to moving past an humiliating experience is to grasp what the emotion is and why it shows up. Humiliation is the experience of losing a piece of your status as a valuable human being. This diminishment has negative consequences for your life because your status as a worthwhile person affects what you think is possible.If you feel intense humiliation, it may change what you think you can do with your life, such as your ability to pursue an education or potential to have the career you want. Some common humiliating experiences are:\n\n\nBeing publicly shamed, like being laughed at or mocked.\nBeing denied basic needs, like food and clothing.\n Research shows that being humiliated can have powerful negative effects on a person\u2019s self-esteem and quality of life. It can result in major depression, symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder like high anxiety, and suicidal desires.If you feel yourself slipping into serious mental health problems because of a humiliating experience, contact your doctor or local psychologist about getting help.\n\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy can help restructure your thoughts and lead you to a healthier, more realistic understanding of the situation. It can help you recover your self-worth and belief in your abilities after a bad case of humiliation.Find a local therapist by clicking here.\n Sometimes a person may try to humiliate you despite your innocence in a situation. For example, he might be jealous of your accomplishments and want to make you feel poorly about yourself. It may have nothing to do with you. Before you accept responsibility for your actions, which is different than accepting being humiliated, make sure you actually did something wrong., Many of us may feel humiliated at relatively small things. These failures can feel like a disaster and we may think that people are judging us harshly, but in the bigger picture they probably don\u2019t deserve the significance we place on them. Avoid sweating the small stuff.For example, botching an interview or a live musical performance can be embarrassing, but they shouldn't usually carry the weight of humiliation.\n If someone is humiliating you, even if you did something wrong, you should realize that humiliation is not an effective technique for changing someone\u2019s behavior. Humiliation is a form of punishment, rather than discipline.There\u2019s no excuse for humiliating someone, even a criminal, so avoid giving in to the person\u2019s tactics by accepting the humiliation.","Take responsibility when appropriate.\nAllow yourself to make a few mistakes.\nForgive yourself.\nRealize you\u2019re not alone.\nLearn to let go with mindfulness.\nAvoid putting yourself in toxic situations.\nCultivate humility.\nImprove your self-esteem.\nGet help for other mental health issues.\nResearch self-help techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy.\nUse attention shifting to rewire your emotional reactions.\nExperiment with relaxation techniques to help yourself let go.\nTry the technique of repeated exposure.\nUnderstand where humiliation comes from.\nRecognize the effects of humiliation.\nDetermine if you\u2019re at fault.\nPut the humiliation into context.\nAvoid giving in to humiliation.","How to Forget About an Humiliating Experience"],["If you're going to smoke indoors and you're worried about others smelling your smoke, the best thing you can do to reduce smoke odors is ventilate the room. It won't solve the problem completely, but it will drastically improve the situation over smoking in an unventilated room.Close the door to your room and open a window. You want to restrict smoke odors from traveling to other parts of the building while directing as much of the actual smoke as possible outside.Put a fan in the window. Have it facing outside rather than towards you. This will help pull smoke out of the room and funnel it outdoors.If you're still actively smoking, blow all of your smoke through the back of the fan so that it gets sucked outside.;\n, Some air fresheners and scented candles are specifically designed to mask the smell of smoke. These products are usually available at smoke shops or online. Even if you don't have one of these specialized air fresheners or scented candles, any kind of odor-masking product may help cover up the smell of smoke.However, it's best to stick with just one odor-masking element. Otherwise the room might just smell like a lot of different things and cigarette smoke.\n\n\nAir sanitizers like Ozium are believed to help neutralize odors like cigarette smoke.Febreze can hide bad smells, possibly including cigarette smoke, because it contains hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HP\u03b2CD), an active agent that traps, binds, and retains malodorous molecules.Citrus is typically considered a good masking odor. If you have fresh oranges, even better: peel a few oranges in your room and leave the peels in strategic locations around your room while you wait for the odor to dissipate.Incense, such as cedar wood, may help cover the smell of smoke.However, burning incense may not be allowed in buildings with strict no-smoking policies.\nLeave out a bowl of white vinegar or ammonia. These powerful odors will help mask most odors, including smoke.However, these products do not smell very good, and in the case of ammonia the fumes may be hazardous if left out for prolonged periods of time. You may also have some explaining to do if your roommate or building manager finds bowls of vinegar or ammonia lying around.\nDouse a rag with vanilla extract and hide it under a bed or chair. It should emit a strong vanilla odor which may help mask the smell of smoke., Cigarette smoke particles are very small, and therefore most air purifiers do not effectively remove cigarette particles from the room. However, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and electronic air ionizers are designed to target small particles in the air.Even these types of air purifiers will not completely solve the problem, but they may help reduce lingering odors caused by smoke when used in conjunction with other preventative measures.\n Plants help neutralize odors by absorbing particles from smoke and removing carbon monoxide and other chemicals from the air.Having plants placed around your room can help freshen the air, and make the room look cheerier as well.\n\n\nSome of the best plants for improved air quality include philodendron, spider plants, English ivy, peace lily, daisies, and chrysanthemums.","Ventilate the room.\nMask the smell with other odors.\nTry an air purifier.\nGrow a lot of plants.","How to Hide Smoke Smell Indoors1"],["A graph or chart from another source is first labeled as \u201cFigure X,\u201d though you may opt to abbreviate \"Figure\" to \"Fig.\" Use Arabic numerals (i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc.).Figures should be numbered in the order they appear; your first graph or other illustration is \"Fig. 1,\" your second \"Fig. 2,\" and so on.\n This description serves as the title of the figure and provides your reader with information regarding the graph's content.

If you need help, then you could hire someone to work for you part-time or as an independent contractor.Partnerships don\u2019t always go along smoothly, and you shouldn\u2019t jump into a partnership unless you are prepared to work closely with another person.\n\n\nIt makes sense to form a partnership when the success of the venture depends on having the other person\u2019s participation. For example, the partner may bring needed skills, capital, or network connections to the partnership that are essential for the partnership\u2019s success.;\n, If you don\u2019t know the other partner well, you should try to find out as much about them as possible. You want to figure out how well you will be able to work together. Ideally, you and any partners will have complementary skills.For example, you might be good at finances and legal issues, while the other partner excels at product development and marketing.\n\n\nYou can also consider taking a weekend retreat together. The purpose of the retreat is to allow you and your prospective partner to discuss the expectations you each have.Be sure to discuss what you expect in a partner as well as where you see the business going.\n You might be forming a partnership with someone you have worked with before. In that situation, you probably have a good idea of your partner\u2019s communication style.\n\n\nHowever, if you haven\u2019t worked together before, then see if you can work on a project with each other before forming the partnership.It doesn\u2019t have to be anything large. But you could work as independent contractors for another company on the project. At the end, you will have a better sense of whether you two are effective team members.\n Forming a partnership raises a host of legal issues. A qualified attorney can help you solve problems and provide advice. The attorney can also help you draft the partnership agreement or at least look over the agreement if you draft it yourself.\n\n\nTo find a qualified attorney, you can visit your state\u2019s bar association. These organizations often have referral services which you can use.\nYou might also want to meet with an accountant.An accountant can advise you on tax issues. To find a competent accountant, you can ask your lawyer for recommendations.\n There are generally three types of partnerships, each with their own risks. You should discuss with your partner and your attorney which partnership form is best for you.\n\n\nGeneral partnerships. Partners share equally in profits, management, and liabilities. If you want to deviate from this default, then you need to assign different percentages in the partnership agreement.Limited liability partnerships (LLPs). Under this arrangement, partners are personally shielded from the partnership\u2019s liability. Partners may also have limited input in partnership decisions or be short-term investors in the partnership.Joint ventures. A short-term partnership, e.g., two people working on a single project or for a limited amount of time.\n You should begin the Partnership Agreement by opening a blank word processing document and then labeling the document \u201cPartnership Agreement\u201d at the top of the page. You then want to identify the essential components of the partnership: the partners, the type of partnership you are forming, and the partnership\u2019s name and location.\n\n\nIdentifying the partnership includes naming all of the partners and their places of residence. Then state that the partners agree to the substance of the partnership agreement: \u201cThe Partners agree as follows:\u201dAlso explain what type of business the partnership will be engaged in.For example, \u201cThe partners voluntarily associate themselves as partners to perform the general business of and any other type of business from time to time as agreed to by the Partners.\u201d\nBe sure to include a statement naming the partnership and its principal place of business., In a general partnership, it is assumed that each partner will contribute an equal amount of start-up capital to the partnership. However, if partners contribute an unequal amount, then you should identify the amount contributed by each as well as the type of capital contributed (whether cash or property).\n\n\nInclude language like the following: \u201cEach partner shall contribute to the Partnership an initial contribution of capital.\u201d Then list each partner and specify how he or she will make the contribution. For example: \u201cMargaret Wesson: Capital contribution shall consist of cash in the amount of $25,000.\u201d\n\n, Any property the partners contribute to the partnership becomes the property of the partnership. Also, any property purchased by the partnership belongs to the partnership as well. You should identify any exceptions in your partnership agreement, in case partners want to retain title to their property.\n\n\nFor example, you would state: \u201cIt is agreed that the 2014 Toyota Camry is being made available to the partnership by Ethan Smith solely for the use of the partnership and that it is to remain the property of the lender. It shall be returned on January 1, 2018 or when the partnership is dissolved, if prior to that date.\u201d, You can divide profit and losses however you want. For example, you might divide them equally. Or you could divide them in proportion to each partner\u2019s capital contribution. Because this is a key element of the partnership, you should come to an agreement with the other partners before drafting this section of the partnership agreement.You should list the partners along with their ownership percentage. Then you can explain that profits will be distributed based on this percentage: \u201cGenerally, gross cash distribution will be made in proportion to Partners\u2019 percentages of partnership interest. Operating expenses will also be shared generally at the time those expenses are realized in proportion to Partners\u2019 percentages of partnership interest.\u201dAlso be sure to explain how profits will be distributed. You might distribute only once a year or you could allow partners to make periodic withdrawals. If you allow periodic draws, then be sure to specify how much each partner may withdraw at one time. For example: \u201cUnless and until modified by the unanimous written consent of the partners, will be entitled to a monthly draw of $_____.\u201d\n\n, This is another key part of the agreement. During the normal course of business, countless decisions will have to be made. For example, you may end up buying office supplies for the partnership or purchasing online advertisements. The partnership agreement should identify the people who can make these decisions.\n\n\nAlso be sure to clarify who in the partnership has the power to bind the partnership in a contract. Generally, any partner can bind the entire partnership.However, you can change this default rule. For example, you may only want to authorize one partner to enter into contracts.\nAlternately, you could give all partners the ability to form contracts provided the contract is not worth more than a certain amount. For any contract in excess of this amount, then you can specify that the partner needs the express written consent of all other partners., Partners end up leaving partnerships for a variety of reasons. For example, they may want to retire. Alternately, they might want to withdraw from the partnership in order to form a different partnership with someone else. Sometimes, partners also need to be expelled. Your agreement should explain the mechanisms for each.\n\n\nYou can provide for retirement or withdrawal by explaining what steps the partner must take, e.g., providing written notice by registered or certified mail to all of the other partners. Also stipulate how much advance notice the other partners must receive.Explain the grounds for expelling a partner. The most common include the failure to make a required capital contribution, failure to fulfill an obligation under the agreement, mental disability, and legal insanity or incompetency.Also explain the process for how the partnership can expel the member. For example, you could decide that the partners will take a vote. Explain whether the vote needs to be majority, unanimous, or some other percentage. Also explain how much notice the expelled partner will be given., You must define under what situations the partnership can be dissolved. Generally, partnerships dissolve automatically on the death of one of the partners, but you can provide for the continued life of the partnership. Explain what triggers dissolution and what steps the partners need to take to keep the partnership going.\n\n\nFor example, many partnerships dissolve when a partner withdraws, retires, or is expelled; a partner dies or enters bankruptcy; a partner becomes incapacitated; or all partners unanimously agree to dissolve.Explain what then happens when dissolution is triggered: \u201cOn dissolution, the remaining partners shall have the right to elect to continue business under the partnership name, by themselves, or with any new persons that they choose.\u201dBy including this language, you give yourself the option of continuing with the partnership as is. Be sure to state whether the vote must be unanimous, by majority, or by some other percentage.\n All partnership agreements should have a \u201cmerger\u201d clause. This clause explains that the document contains the entirety of the partners\u2019 agreement. This clause helps pre-empt a partner from later claiming that there were oral agreements between the partners that were not included in the agreement but which should be enforced.\n\n\nA typical merger clause looks like this: \u201cThis Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties hereto and may not be modified or amended except by a writing signed by the parties.\u201d, All of the partners must sign their names and write the date.You should also have the partnership agreement notarized.\n You need to register a DBA (\u201cDoing Business As\u201d) name with your state if it differs from the partnership\u2019s legal name. For a partnership, the legal name is either the name listed in the partnership agreement or the last names of the partners.For example, if the partnership is named Wesson & Peters, but you want to do business as \u201cThe Tax Guys,\u201d then you need to register that name.\nContact your county clerk\u2019s office and ask if you need to register the DBA at either the state or county level (or both)., If you form a limited liability partnership, then you will probably need to file a \u201cregistration\u201d or \u201ccertificate\u201d with the Secretary of State\u2019s office.By contrast, if you have a general partnership, then you might not have to file anything. Check with your lawyer.\n Before you can legally run a business, you need to have the proper licenses and permits from your state or municipality. To find out what licenses or permits you need, you can use the Small Business Association\u2019s Licensing and Permits tool at https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/content\/what-state-licenses-and-permits-does-your-business-need. Click on your state to find out what you need.\n You need to set up the partnership\u2019s bank accounts. In order to do so, you will need to take the following documents to the bank:The partnership\u2019s Employer Identification Number (also called a \u201cEIN\u201d or \u201cTIN\u201d). You can get this number for free by contacting the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at (800) 829-4933 or by visiting https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/Businesses\/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed\/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-(EIN)-Online.\nA copy of your partnership agreement.\nYour business certificate from the state, which shows the partnership\u2019s name as well as the names of the individual partners.\n Unless you are running a partnership from your home, you will need an office. You should think about the following when negotiating a commercial lease:Try not to overcommit on the lease. You want to leave some flexibility. Specifically, you should avoid getting locked into a long lease; instead, a one or two year lease would be ideal.\nPay attention to extras not included in the rent. The landlord might charge you for utilities, maintenance fees, and upkeep for common areas. Ask about all \u201chidden fees\u201d before signing a lease.\nAsk whether the lease allows subleasing. Also check if there is an exclusivity clause that prevents the landlord from leasing to one of your competitors on the same premises. Both of these could be beneficial to you.\nFigure out what happens in the event of default. Although it\u2019s painful to consider, your business might not be successful. In that case, you may need to dissolve the partnership. Find out if you are obligated to continue to pay on the lease, or whether you can end the lease early by paying only one more month\u2019s rent.","Decide if you need a partner.\nInterview potential partners.\nSee how well you work together with your partner.\nMeet with an attorney.\nSettle on a partnership form.\nIdentify the business.\nState each partner\u2019s capital contribution.\nIdentify other partnership property.\nDecide how to divide profits and losses.\nOutline how business decisions are made.\nExplain how a person can exit the business partnership.\nProvide instructions for dissolution.\nState that the agreement is complete.\nInclude a signature block.\nRegister your partnership name.\nFile a certificate with the state.\nObtain necessary licenses and permits.\nGet necessary bank accounts.\nFind real estate.","How to Set Up a Business Partnership"],["Using a Worsted Weight yarn and an H hook, make a foundation chain.

If you're wary about using a credit card, consider taking out a personal loan from your bank.\n\n\nBank loans have a fixed interest rate and a fixed amount of time where you have to pay. This prevents you from accruing large amounts of interest over time. A bank loan can also help your credit rating, especially if you've never taken out a loan before.\nEven with low interest, keep in mind interest rates on loans can still add quite a bit to the final cost. Try to ask for a secured loan if you know you can make payments on time.\n Depending on your financial situation and credit score, a bank might not approve a loan for cosmetic surgery. If this is the case, you can look into alternative types of loans. One such type is an unsecured medical loan.\n\n\nUnsecured medical loans are usually brokered through third parties. Your doctor may offer to act as a third party to help you get an unsecured medical loan. This is a good option if you have a low credit score and are having trouble securing money through other means.Interest rates on these types of loans can be quite high. You also might need a co-signer and if you fail to make payments your negligence will affect the co-signer's credit rating. Always read fine print when taking out a loan of this type. If you have any questions, consult an attorney., If you have a 401K you can withdraw up to 50% of the balance. Repayments are automatically deducted from your paycheck. While this allows you to avoid interest rates and prevents you from missing payments, this can affect your taxes. You might lose certain tax benefits or have to pay double taxes for some costs. Talk to an accountant before taking money out of your 401K.\n If you're a home owner, a home equity loan can help pay for cosmetic surgery. These loans use your house as leverage and the amounts are based on your current mortgage payments.\n\n\nAs mortgage rates are at historic lows, this can be very affordable for homeowners. It is also a fairly quick way to get the needed money together. The housing market, however, is extremely volatile. If anything should happen and you need to sell your home, having taken out a home equity loan puts you in an extremely vulnerable financial position.Home equity loans are easy to obtain but as they carry a somewhat high risk they should be a last resort.","Take out a bank loan.\nLook into unsecured medical loans.\nUse your 401K.\nTake out a home equity loan.","How to Pay for Plastic Surgery2"],["Cystic acne affects tissue that is deeper down than its more superficial counterpart, common acne.

Bruises and punctures leave the banana exposed to air, which speeds up the ripening process.\nDo not choose bananas that are already yellow. Bananas ripen at a rapid pace and their shelf-life is very short.For this reason, you want to make sure you buy bananas that are on the greener side; this will give you more time to properly store your bananas before the ripening process occurs.;\n, Avoid exposing them to heat as this will speed up the ripening process.\n\n\nDo not place bananas in the fridge before they are ripe. This can actually have a reverse effect and turn your banana peels brown faster. This occurs because the cold causes the cell walls to break down prematurely, which allows the production of melanin, turning bananas completely black. Contra-intuitively, the inside of the banana will still not be ripe since the cold inhibits the ripening process of the fruit., This prevents them from getting bruised and becoming exposed to air. You can also seal the stem of the banana bunch with plastic wrap.This limits the amount of oxygen the stem receives and can keep bananas fresh for another week.\n Fruits and vegetables give off a gas that speeds ripening.\n\n\nStoring produce together can speed up the ripening process. Plants naturally produce a gas called ethylene, which causes them to ripen. Fruits or vegetables that are already brown give off more ethylene than normal, causing nearby fresh produce to ripen faster.\nDo not store bananas in sealed bags. This will cause the bananas to turn brown faster because the ethylene hormone will be unable to escape from the air surrounding the bananas.\n Now that the ripening process has begun, you can safely delay it with the application of cold temperature.\n\n\nTo stop ripening, you need to slow down the chemical reaction. Cold temperatures will slow down the reaction, delaying the banana fruit from ripening.\nDo not be alarmed if your banana peel turns completely black, which it most likely will. This is due to the pigment of the peel turning black and does not have anything to do with the actual freshness of the banana. The banana should still taste flavorful and remain slightly firm.","Purchase bananas that are green on the ends and yellow in the middle.\nStore bananas at room temperature until they are ripe.\nHang your bananas on a banana hanger.\nKeep your bananas separate from other fruits and vegetables.\nPlace bananas in the refrigerator once they are ripe.","How to Keep Bananas from Ripening Too Fast1"],["It\u2019s the blue chat bubble icon with a white lightning bolt.

If you introduce a bunch of new, extremely restrictive (or extremely lax) rules following a divorce, you\u2019ll only add to their stress, confusion, and unhappiness. Once your divorce is finalized, carry over as many of the rules as possible from the time before you and your spouse divorced.If you do decide to change a rule, then make sure that you evaluate your reasons for the rule change. For example, if you decide to change your child's bedtime, then consider whether you are changing the bedtime because your child is getting older, or if you are changing the bedtime to be the \u201ccool\u201d parent.;\n, You and your ex might not agree on all the rules. Even many parents who are not divorced often disagree on the rules for their kids. But think about each rule carefully and recognize the difference between an important rule (like \u201cNo playing near the street by yourself\u201d) and a trivial rule (like \u201cNo television after 8:00\u201d). Let your ex know that you expect consistency with these more serious rules. Learn to compromise on rules that don\u2019t directly affect your child\u2019s health and well-being., If you allow your kids to do something that your ex doesn\u2019t allow (or vice versa), they will come to resent the parent who restricts their freedom. Being consistent between households is also important to avoid confusion for your kids.Talk to your ex about specific rules for your kids that you believe you should both share between households. Ask your ex if they have any suggestions for rules, too. Listen to their ideas and implement the rules in your own household if you agree.\n Not only should expectations and privileges be the same for your kids no matter where they are, but they should also get rewarded the same way. So if your ex brings your kids back in the evening and says he or she promised them they could stay up a bit late tonight because they helped clean up the house, you should honor that. Likewise, if your ex informs you that your child has been naughty and therefore is not permitted television for the rest of the day, let your child know that their behavior has consequences in your house, too., It\u2019s easy to give in to a child\u2019s complaints. But if you do, your kids will only push you for more and more leeway on the rules. Soon enough, they\u2019ll be in control, and that\u2019s a situation you don\u2019t want to be in. Be firm, clear, and consistent when applying the rules and administering discipline.Whether you want to make them happy or just want them to stop nagging, you\u2019ll probably have moments of weakness and give in to their child. But you should try to limit these occasions as much as possible, and let your kids know that you\u2019re making a special exception. This way, they will understand that they should not expect you to agree to, for instance, staying up late or watching an extra hour of TV every time they ask for it.\nMake sure that the things you give in to are acceptable. For example, if you have a \u201cno soda\u201d rule, then allowing your child to have a cola on the weekend might be acceptable. However, allowing your child to skip doing their homework would not be an acceptable thing to give in to your child about.\n If you and your ex are not on good terms, or are tense around each other, your kids will notice. And if you criticize your ex directly to your kids, they will definitely notice. They might repeat these criticisms to your ex, causing the relationship between you to deteriorate. When you and your ex aren\u2019t getting along, it can be difficult to coordinate child care, including disciplinary issues.If you find your ex really repulsive, spend as little time around them as possible.

You can choose to start in the corner of the pen for the time being, or near its food and water.\n\nUse a pail or stool or log to sit on, or anything that is relatively comfortable. This is because you may be seated for about a half-hour at a time or more. Sitting is also better than squatting, though both methods are used to make you look smaller and more vulnerable than you actually are.\nIf you find a clean place on the ground to sit on and wish to sit there instead, then feel free to use that. This will certainly eliminating the need for a pail, cut log, stool, or anything else bring and sit on.;\n, This will give the calf the impression that your focus is completely off him and only on the object in your hand, making you appear less threatening.\n\nIt's completely up to you if you feel comfortable reading silently or out loud the calf. Some may recommend reading out loud to get the calf used to your voice, and some may not. It just depends on your comfort level.\n Read aloud, or silently (your choice), and look around every so often to see how the calf is reacting to you. He may be curious at first and make some movement to come up to you, or he may stand and stare at you, then go find a place to hide or get as far away from you as possible. This completely normal, especially for a calf that is both not used to you nor accustomed to human contact.\n\nIf he does come up to you out of curiosity, move very little and avoid petting him. Just let him sniff at you and move away when he wants to.\nDon't be disappointed if the calf is more interested in its food or sleeping than you, because this may actually be a good sign. If a calf is feeling alarmed or frightened of you he won't be interested in eating or finding a place to nap. Rather he will be pacing around his pen, avoiding you, and trying to find a way out. He may just be walking around a lot, casting nervous glances at you.\n Do the same again as indicated in the steps above. Continue to do this until the calf appears comfortable around you: This is indicated by eating or grazing, and\/or laying down in your presence. This may take you anywhere from after 3 attempts to at least 10. It will depend on the individual calf., This may mean taking your time with feeding the calf, talking to him as you do so, and staying for a few minutes afterward. If you've figured out a name for him, then use that so he knows who you're calling him by.\n\nDon't try to reach out and pet the calf just yet, because you should be more focused on him getting comfortable being near you than you trying to touch it.\n Try to offer the feed to him at first with your hand, holding it somewhat low where you're sitting. If that fails after several minutes, then leave it on the ground in a pile near you; not under you. Stay where you are, and try not to pay too much attention to the calf, which includes not touching him if he comes to sniff at the pile you left for him. If he doesn't come close to eat the pile or attempts to sniff your hand, then leave the calf be and try again the next time., This may take several tries in combination with the step above, so patience and time is needed. But don't spend too long at it; 10 to 20 minutes is ideal for each session.\n\nTake this as an opportunity to stand up while offering the feed. He will have seen you standing and walking as you come in and out of his pen to clean out his bedding and feed him, so in combination with you sitting and reading with him, this part shouldn't cause much trouble with the calf. Especially if you are consistent in being the one to bed and feed him regularly.\n Avoid touching the top of the head or the muzzle; instead start from the chin and under the jaw, with a gentle touch at first. If the calf doesn't move away from you with that touch, turn it into a gentle scratch for a couple seconds.\n\nFrom there you can move, using the calf as a guide to let you know how comfortable he is with you (don't force yourself on him, in other words), from his chin and jaw down his neck to his chest. It's very important that you move in baby steps, repeating from the same or similar spot you started him with before moving just a little farther each time. But don't push it. If he moves away because he's not comfortable with the new spot your scratching him on, let him move away, but get him to come back to you right away so that you're not ending on a negative note.\nIt's at this time you can also try to get him comfortable with putting and having a halter on to start halter-breaking him. Once you have the halter on him you can really begin to get him to get comfortable with you touching and grooming him. Remember to use yourself and the halter as a source where good things come from.\n Bovines are very food-motivated, calves especially, so \"bribing\" him with food will be very easy especially now that he understands who and where his feed is coming from.

Eventually you may be able to call his name without having any treats for him and he'll readily come to you.","Find a place to sit and something to sit on in the calf's pen.\nBring a book or tablet to read from.\nRemain in your spot for 20 to 30 minutes at a time.\nLeave your spot and return the next day or a few hours later.\nMake feeding time a time your calf will associate you with good things.\nWhen not feeding, and after the calf is comfortable sitting or eating with you, you can try to coax him with a handful of grass or hay, or a taste of pellets or grain.\nOnce the calf has become comfortable enough to come and eat from the pile next to you, try once again to get him to eat from your hands.\nIf you finally have the calf eating from your hands, now try to touch him.\nOnce you have him comfortable with touching him, then you can start training him to come to you.","How to Get a Hand Shy Calf to Let You Approach It"],["This helps trigger your memory.\n This helps you to begin thinking about it in your own terms and helps you to better conceptualize it., This can hone your technique for writing down only what matters, in terms that make sense to you., These are red flags for later deeper research., This means listening with care and noticing when your mind is wandering or you feel distracted and forcing yourself to return to paying attention., Listen with clarity.

These degrees are less relevant than actual work experience, but they can help you get your foot in the door.The most relevant Bachelor\u2019s degrees are broadcast journalism, communications, and film. However, a college degree is not required for the field and even a relevant degree might do little to advance your prospects.;\n, Shorter training programs, known as \"boot camps,\" teach skills important for a PA in a condescended period of time. These are more closely tailored to the specific demands of a PA than college programs and can look great on a resume. These typically cost approximately $200 for a two-day course.\n\n\nThese programs are concentrated in areas with a thriving media industry, like Atlanta, New York, and Los Angeles., The best way to get into the industry is to get experience working in it. Unfortunately, that means you often need to work as an unpaid intern for several months. Try running errands on a local independent film production crew or at a local television station's production department.\n\n\nSome cable systems will have local origination programming on which they will welcome a volunteer production assistant. They may have an informal (and free) training program, as well.\n As a production assistant, you should be willing to work long hours in return for the experience. You might need to work 12-hour days mostly standing up. You will often be required to perform menial tasks, like picking up coffee, and will be judged on how well you perform even the smallest task.Though the job is grueling it doesn\u2019t pay well, usually no more than minimum wage, and sometimes less. To keep yourself motivated you should think about the long-term career opportunities that can develop from a PA job., A production assistant works with people in all roles of production, including the director, assistant director, producer, lighting director, camera operators, talent and extras. You will often be required to perform tasks like answering the phone. That means that you need to be able to express ideas clearly both through written and spoken English.Taking college courses in the humanities will often help you develop your writing skills.\nWorking in sales or services industries can be a good way to develop your oral communication skills.\n One of your principal responsibilities as a PA will be editing video. Each station will use a different type of non-linear editor and will usually be willing to train you in the one that they use. However, you should at least be able to demonstrate that you have some experience editing video.\n\n\nPrograms that channels use include: Avid, Quantel, Final Cut Pro, and Sony.\n Production assistants are not generally required to operate the camera, but production assistants can be asked to perform almost any function at the studio when the need arises. Knowing how to operate the camera can give you an advantage. Furthermore, successfully operating the camera when needed can be a ticket to a better position in the future.Studying film in college is a good way to learn about operating the camera. Alternatively, some organizations offer short courses in filmmaking that can help you develop your skills with the camera.\n You will need to become familiar with the roles of a typical production crew. Some colleges offering programs in production have free course material available online.\n\n\nBe fluent in the use of a radio (walkie talkie) and surveillance mic equipment.\nExamples of relevant terminology include terms like: \u201ccut,\u201d \u201cdolly,\u201d \u201cframing,\u201d \u201cstory board,\u201d and \u201cwipe.\u201d, As a production assistant you will be expected to know something about the content that you report on. If you want to be in sports, you will need to know about sports. If you want to work in news, you will be expected to understand politics. Figure out what field you are interested in and start doing research.\n\n\nNo one is, or should be, a production assistant forever. It pays too poorly to be anything other than a stepping stone to a better career. Thus, you should know what positions you want to move on to and begin preparing yourself for the expectations.\nIf you can, speak to someone in the field about what the expectations and career trajectories are.\n You should keep these on you at all times, because you never know when you will meet someone who will be able to recommend you for your first job in your career in production. Be sure that your networking materials include your cell phone number or a current phone number. Your resume should speak to how you possess the aforementioned skills, including communication, camera operation, work ethic, attention to detail, and video editing.\n You will need to demonstrate that you can edit video to get a job as a production assistant. Keep a reel of video that you have edited to share with potential employers. Use your time in college or in a production boot camp to develop such a reel with professional input.If you can, try to have reel ready that it is pertinent to the position you are applying for. Though if you don\u2019t have relevant material it should be fine, because it will still show that you have the basic skills necessary to edit film.\n Contact production coordinators, producers, or assistant directors either by telephone or in person. Give them your resume and make a pitch for why you are qualified for the job. If you know anyone in the business, see if they can put in a good word for you.\n\n\nLeave your resume and card and follow up soon after the first contact. You should follow up periodically thereafter.\n You can\u2019t live forever on a PA job. The point of the position is to get experience behind the scenes, to learn the intricacies of production, meet leading figures in the field, and learn from their insights. Whether you are still looking for a PA job or have just gotten one, you should work hard to meet important people in the field.Interacting with people on social media can be a good way to introduce yourself to people in the field.\nLook for local events that will likely attract people interested in media.\nNever stop looking to meet new people.

You can\u2019t expect it to go from 100 to 0 simply by getting in bed and pulling up the covers. So spend about 30-45 minutes slowly shutting down your brain and body.\n\n\nYou might do this by taking a hot shower or bath. When you get out, your core body temperature drops, which is a signal to your brain to produce melatonin, your body\u2019s natural sleep hormone.Other ways to prepare for sleep are by putting away the electronic gadgets and gaming systems and, instead, reading a book, listening to classical or relaxing music or by doing easy stretches., Caffeine is a stimulant, and while most people associate it with coffee, it\u2019s also in tea, chocolate, soda and some pain relievers. Sleep experts recommend avoiding these things for 6 hours before going to sleep.\n\n\nThis may seem like a really long time, but that\u2019s how long it takes for caffeine to leave your bloodstream., When you exercise vigorously, your body temperature goes up, and it takes several hours for it to drop to normal levels again. Because lower body temperature is needed for better sleep, don\u2019t exercise for 3-4 hours before going to sleep.On the flip side, exercising regularly promotes good sleep. The precise mechanism between regular exercise and sleep is still uncertain, but numerous studies on various populations have shown that it works., Turn off the TV, and put away your cell phones, computers and tablets once you\u2019re in bed. They not only prevent you from winding down because you\u2019re so busy clicking, scrolling, typing, chatting and so forth, but they also trick your body into thinking it\u2019s daytime and, therefore, not time to go to bed.\n\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. These devices emit a type of blue light that mimics natural light, thereby suppressing melatonin levels. When this occurs, your brain tells your body it\u2019s not time to sleep; it disrupts your circadian rhythm.TVs also emit this light, but the problem is amplified with cell phones, laptops and tablets because they are closer to your face.\n Turn off all lights while you sleep. Your circadian rhythm, or inner clock, is largely regulated by exposure to light and dark, with melatonin secreted in darkness and suppressed in light. Since melatonin induces sleep, the darker your room the better.You might also want to dim the lights during those 30-45 minutes that you are powering down before bedtime as a cue to your brain that it\u2019s almost time to go to sleep.\nIf you live with a roommate or there are lights that you just can\u2019t avoid, try wearing an eye mask to block out the light.\n Make sure you stick to your bedtime each night of the week. While it will be tempting to stay up late on the weekends, doing so will really throw a wrench in your internal clock and make Monday mornings rather unpleasant.","Power down before bedtime.\nStay away from caffeine before bed.\nAvoid rigorous exercise before bed.\nBreak electronic insomnia.\nDarken your room.\nGo to sleep the same time each night.","How to Get Used to Waking up Early for School4"],["It's a blue app that contains a lowercase, white \"f.\", It's in the upper-left corner of the screen, at the top of your Newsfeed, in the status box next to \"What's on your mind?\"., These are the photos in the \"Featured\" section of your profile, below your Bio and above the status box that asks, \"What's on your mind?\", It's below the photos that appear in this section.\n\nIf you haven't added any featured photos yet, tap Add Featured Photos in the same section.\n Tap on a photo icon in the center of a gray square or in the lower-left corner of an existing photo.\n\nFeatured photos are supposed to help others get to know you a little better, so choose photos that tell something about yourself.\nYou can add up to five featured photos.\nFeatured photos are always public and can be seen by anyone., Do so if you want to add a photo from your device's camera roll\/gallery., Select this option if you want to use a photo from your Facebook albums., Tap the blue \u24e7 in the upper-right corner of any photo to delete it., It's in the upper-right corner.

The cover letter should include your name and address, maybe your bio, as well as a quick look at the story.The brief look at your story is not a summary. Rather, limit this to 25 words and quickly explain who the main character is and what the conflict is about.\nAddress the letter to the editor by name. You can usually find the names of editors in the \u201cAbout\u201d sections of magazine websites or in books previously published.;\n, In case your submission is chosen, the editors may want to include a short bio about you, about 3 sentences long. To prevent them from having to do more work by asking you for a bio once they are ready to publish, furnish them with one in your cover letter. Keep this bio about your work, not your likes and dislikes.You may want to list where you live, work, and where else you have been published. If you\u2019ve never been published, focus on your experience and education.\n Decorative fonts like script or cursive make your writing unprofessional and your words difficult to read. Since the industry standard is plain, clear fonts like Calibri and Times, your submission should reflect understanding of this. If you want to be taken seriously, be serious about your font.Also avoid creative font colors and varying sizes of font.\n No matter what writing style editors prefer, they all like to get stories that are polished--and that means proofreading. Also look at your story for awkward wording and redundancy to boost the story's appeal.\n\n\nTake into account that many editors don't like to see overwriting. Paring down your extra adjectives and being conservative with adverbs can keep your language simple yet engaging.One way to trim the fat from your writing is to use simple dialogue tags like \u201csaid\u201d instead of flowery verbs like \u201cuttered.\u201d\n\n, Write down or type up a list of where you send your stories and when. This way, if you send the same story to multiple magazines, it will be easy to figure out who to tell if your story gets accepted. You can\u2019t have your work published in more than one place at a time.If you do submit the same story to different magazines at the same time, inform the editors in your cover letter that it is a \u201csimultaneous submission\u201d and assure them that you will inform them if your story is chosen elsewhere before they get to it.\nSome journals and magazines do not accept simultaneous submissions. Such magazines will sometimes automatically reject your story if this is the case. Read closely when you send in your story to make sure it is ok to send it to more than one place at the same time.\n One of the best ways to reduce your risk of getting rejected is to read the magazine you want to be published in. Some writers refer to this as \u201cresearch,\u201d and it truly is the only way to tell if your story will be a good fit for the magazine. Read the short stories they publish and look for tone and writing style. If yours doesn\u2019t match, it is doubtful you will be published.Another way to find a magazine that will fit the style of your story is to look at the publication history of your favorite contemporary author and see what magazines they submit to. Chances are that your style models theirs, so magazines that took their story might accept yours.\n Another way to make sure you don\u2019t get immediately rejected is to read the submission guidelines. For example, many magazines only publish particular genres, and others change what kind of stories they want every few months. If your story doesn\u2019t meet the guidelines, you will quickly be rejected and perhaps even labeled as a lazy submitter.Submission guidelines are usually posted on the same page as the online submission portal or near the address where editors want stories received.\n Literary magazines, usually either university or indie presses, are mainly the ones who take short stories. There are many other magazines out there, from scientific to pop culture, but most of these magazines aren\u2019t looking for short stories. Focus on finding literary magazines.\n\n\nLiterary magazines aren\u2019t the only magazines that take short stories. The New Yorker, for example, has a short story section.\nThere are many articles on the internet that compile lists of magazines that accept stories. Find one of these lists to get started.Some magazines advertise for submissions to \u201ccontests\u201d rather than directly to their magazines, so include the word \u201ccontest\u201d in an internet search for magazines to submit to.\n Look on the websites of different magazines to figure out how and where to submit your story. Some websites have submission portals where you simply upload your story, whereas others require you to mail in a paper copy.\n\n\nIf the latter is required, the address to send the story will be published on the magazine\u2019s website or can be obtained over the phone and in previous magazine printings.\n It can feel devastating to be rejected by a magazine, especially when you have put a lot of work into a story. But don\u2019t shut down. Rejections can happen for more reasons than simply that your story \u201cwasn\u2019t good.\u201d You may have misinterpreted the submission guidelines or been a bad fit for the magazine. Get back out there and find other magazines to submit to.\n\n\nDon\u2019t try to contact a magazine that has rejected your story. This displays immaturity and a misunderstanding of how the publishing industry works.You don\u2019t have to steer clear of a magazine just because they rejected one story. Unless they ask you to stop submitting, you can continue to submit other stories.\nThe truth is that the publishing industry is very competitive, and even small presses get flooded with submissions. As a result, almost all submissions get rejected. Don't take it personally.\n Keep submitting your stories to magazines. If you are a strong writer, one day you will most likely be accepted. Find other writers to encourage you when you get discouraged, and revise your stories. You can even tailor a story to fit the style of a particular magazine to increase your odds of being accepted., Once you get accepted, the editors might want additional items from you, like your approval for edits they want to make. These will more than likely be formatting and proofreading changes rather than changes to the meaning of your words.\n\n\nSend a thank you letter when accepted. A thank you email works, but a real letter makes more of a lasting impact, which can increase your reputation and odds of getting published again., Even though you are a writer in a publication and may receive free copies of the magazine as a result, it is polite to purchase a few copies. This helps the magazine stay running and gives you more copies to circulate among friends and colleagues.","Write a cover letter.\nWrite a brief bio about yourself.\nAvoid decorative fonts.\nMake sure you revise.\nRecord where you submit.\nRead the magazine.\nRead submission guidelines.\nLearn the types of magazines that take stories.\nFind submission portals.\nBe ok with rejection.\nTry again with other magazines if you are rejected.\nSend the editor what they need if accepted.\nBuy copies of the magazine you are published in.","How to Submit a Story to a Magazine"],["After brushing the hair, part it in the middle.

For example, let us assume that the director represents a corporation that operates hotels. The hotel chain is looking to contract with a laundry company to clean the hotel\u2019s linens. The director of the hotel company enters into a contract on behalf of the hotel with the director\u2019s own laundry company at a price that is twice the cost of other laundry companies for the same services. In this situation, the director of the hotel company engaged in self-dealing because he entered into a contract on behalf of the hotel in order to unfairly benefit his own personal interests.;\n, A conflict of interest arises when the director of a corporation has an interest in both the corporation and some entity that the corporation is dealing with. This can take the form of the director being a shareholder of another company that the corporation is dealing with, the director having a competing business, or the director\u2019s close family member standing to benefit from a contract that corporation intends to enter into.\nIf a director has a conflict of interest, he or she must disclose that conflict of interest to the board. Failure to disclose the conflict is a breach of the duty of loyalty. Simply having a conflict of interest does not preclude a director from serving on a board. The board should, however, limit that director\u2019s involvement with the decision making on those matters in which the conflict arises. If the director must be involved in the decision-making of a deal in which he or she has a conflict of interest, other independent board members should sign off on the deal as well.\n If an opportunity presents itself to a director or officer of a corporation that may be an opportunity for the corporation, the director or officer must present that opportunity to the corporation. The officer must not take the corporate opportunity for himself or herself to the detriment of the corporation. There is a high penalty placed upon the director for doing so: all the profits from the \u201cstolen\u201d transaction will be taken from the director and given to the corporation. An example of a violation of the corporate opportunity is if a director learns of the sale of a certain piece of property that could be of substantial value. If the company the director works for deals with real estate of the type that the director learns about, and the director purchases the property anyway, the director violated his or her fiduciary duties owed to the company.","Avoid self-dealing.\nAvoid conflicts of interest.\nAvoid taking an opportunity away from the corporation.","How to Uphold a Fiduciary Duty1"],["Stretch your legs out straight and hold your arms outstretched at your sides.

Prophetic dreams, also called \u201cprecognitive dreams,\u201d do not occur much, if at all, so you will have to be vigilant when it comes to remembering and reading your dreams. With effort, you can get better at holding onto the dreams, images, and symbols after waking.When you wake, hold the dream in your mind\u2019s eye. This is when the dream is freshest and before your mind might unwittingly add to it.\nTry to recall the whole dream, include places, colors, emotions, and images. Each detail of the dream matters.Try to figure what where you were, what you were doing, who else appeared in your dream, and what was the interaction between you and others.Focus on these images rather than a narrative. Dreams are often just a series of images and not connected in a coherent way, and our mind later orders them.;\n, Putting down the dream in writing will help you to reinforce it in your memory. Start a notebook dedicated to your dreams, using it to record images and sequence whenever possible, improving your recall.Place the dream journal near your bed. That way, you can grab it immediately after waking up and record what you experienced.\nHaving your dreams in a notebook will also be useful when you start your analysis. You will be able to compare dreams with those in the past, contrast symbols, and also have a handy reference.\n In reading dreams, you\u2019ll need to focus on several factors. One of these is context and setting. Pay attention to where dreams occur, what it is like, and whether or not the setting is familiar to you.\n\n\nDid your dream occur somewhere that you have been before, for example? Or perhaps it was a strange location or even your mind\u2019s invention? These details could point to meaning.\nBe aware of the dream\u2019s time-frame. For example, while some dreams take place at an indeterminate time, others are vaguely in the future or have a clear date.\nNote any associations that you have with a dream\u2019s context, as well. Were you at your late grandparents\u2019 farm? Maybe you were at church. Write these details down, too.\n Note the people, animals, or other non-human beings that appear to you in dreams and consider your relationship to them. The figures who appear in our dreams can sometimes carry meaning or represent other parts of our psyche, that is, parts of the mind that might want to give you a message.\n\n\nRecord who these figures are and what they do in your dream, making sure to analyze how they interact with you. Be as specific as possible.\nPeople in your dreams may not represent anything out of the ordinary. For instance, if you dream about an ex-boyfriend, he might simply represent your ex-boyfriend.\nSometimes, however, figures appear in dreams that carry messages. Figures with whom you have a less direct personal relationship can especially be these harbingers of news \u2013 or even of the future., Dreams often have an emotional overtone or feeling to them, recording and analyzing which may give you insight into its possible meaning for the future. Focus on how you felt during the dream.When you take down your impressions for each dream, pause on the emotions and try to puzzle them out. Did you feel anxious \u2013 why? Did you feel fearful or hopeful? Again, why?\n\n, If you want to predict the future through your dreams, you\u2019ll need to inform yourself about dreams as such and their meaning. For one thing, your daily life and emotions have a lot do to with what you dream. They can contain fragments of our activities and thoughts as well as anxieties, hopes, and fears. If you dream about flying or coming to class naked, for example, you are probably dreaming about suppressed fears rather than the future.\n\n\nYou might try reading up on dream symbology to help in your self-analysis. The idea that dreams reflect the subconscious and can \u201csymbolize\u201d things in our minds was pioneered by psychologists like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, for example. Pick up a copy of Freud\u2019s \u201cThe Interpretation of Dreams,\u201d if you feel up to it.\nCarl Jung even thought that some images in dreams access a \u201ccollective unconscious\u201d that cuts across all places and times. You\u2019ll need to bone up on these ideas if you want to identify precognitive dreams., Some people have extended the work of thinkers like Freud and Jung and put together \u201cdictionaries\u201d of dream symbols. You can find these on the internet, with a lot of detail for symbols like water, doors, fences, dogs, cats, and other things.\n\n\nTo use one of these resources, go back to your dream journal, find important images, and then search for them. Try to be exhaustive and specific for, as you will see, the dictionaries often give very specific meanings.\nThe idea behind a dream dictionary is that images or symbols have definite meanings, which you can then plug into your dream. For example, you may encounter future trouble with your sexuality if you had a foreboding dream about a mongoose.If you dream that you are trapped inside of a coffin with a mongoose, the dream might mean two things: you will have trouble with your sexuality, and that it is a situation you should address., Once you have a good record of your dreams, more knowledge about dream theories, and access to dictionaries of symbols, try hard to parse your dreams. Put together all of your resources \u2013 are there hidden messages in some?\n\n\nBy categorizing the things that you dream about the most, as well as people, figures, and places, you should start to have a fairly detailed map of your dreams.\nSlowly start to work through your dream journal to see the possible meaning of symbols. Write these symbols down or keep charts, if it helps you to stay organized. Ask yourself: do any elements of your dreams have a possible reading for future events?\nSome precognitive dreams might be easier to spot than others. For example, you may be aware during a dream that you are receiving a prophecy. Alternately, you may meet with a courier \u2013 this is a straightforward symbol that you are getting a message. , Dreams are highly personal and, in fact, scientists still don\u2019t quite know why we dream. If you are seriously interested in dream interpretation, you\u2019ll be happy to know that they may well have some meaning for your life. However, you probably won\u2019t be able to use them to predict the future.\n\n\nSome scientists think that dreams are a result of the brain firing at random. Some think that animals, humans included, evolved dreaming as a defense mechanism, while others believe that we dream in order to process information at the end of the day.Still, other people strongly believe that dreams can be something more. Perhaps they aren\u2019t precognitive, but is it possible that a dream could be a message from someone or something? We really don\u2019t know.\n Analyzing your dreams may well help you to better understand yourself and your subconscious. You may find fears, hopes, and aspirations that you weren\u2019t aware of before. However, whether you can take a specific lesson from a dream is not so clear.\n\n\nDreams and symbols will vary from person to person. While some might be universal, as Jung thought, many more probably aren\u2019t.\nGiven how unproven dream interpretation is, you should be careful about using it to guide your life or as the basis for major decisions., Many dream resources pretend to have all the answers. They will assign detailed, specific meanings for all sorts of symbols. Does dream interpretation really work like this? In fact, it is probably a lot more complex. Don\u2019t trust everything that you read.\n\n\nYou know yourself best, and many times can identify the meaning or association of a symbol better than a dream dictionary. Trust your own judgement.\nIf you want to get to the meaning behind your dreams, you might also try seeing a psychoanalyst. She might not be able to tell your future, but perhaps she can shine some light onto your subconscious.","Try to recall your dreams.\nKeep a dream journal.\nPay attention to context.\nPay attention to dream figures.\nPay attention to emotions.\nLearn more about dreams and their general meaning.\nConsult dream dictionaries.\nTry to tell precognitive dreams from others.\nRecognize the limits of dream science.\nRecognize the limits of dream interpretation.\nBe wary of \u201cone-size fits all\u201d interpretations.","How to Predict the Future by Interpreting Your Dreams"],["This will help you to regain your self esteem.

Rinse with warm water, then pat (don't rub) your face dry with a towel. Avoid putting on moisturizer or sunscreen. These products might cause latex-based makeup to slide off.\n\n\nPull your hair back. If you have long hair or bangs, keep it out of your face while you work. Put it up into a ponytail, and clip stray hairs out of the way with bobby pins or a headband.\nIf you're a guy, you may want to shave before applying any make-up or prosthetic. Latex and gelatin can get stuck in the hair, making it them quite painful to remove.;\n, Liquid latex and gelatin are two substances you can use to create really cool zombie effects - like open wounds, bloody gashes, bite marks and broken noses. Although they might sound intimidating or overly complicated to use, both liquid latex and gelatin are actually surprisingly easy to work with. An explanation of how both products work can be found in parts three and four of this article.\n\n\nIf you do decide to work with either liquid latex or gelatin, they will need to be applied at this point in the make-up process, that is, before you begin working with face paints.\nHowever, if you decide these products are too much work or you don't have time to find them, just skip to the next step. You can still create a hideously decayed zombie look without them!\n\n, Using a soft makeup or stippling sponge, dab the white all over your face. Then blend it in small, light motions until your whole face is covered in a thin layer of makeup. Allow it to dry completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a mottled effect by subtly applying a second color over the white. You can go with grey for an ashen, decayed effect, red or purple for a bruised effect or green and yellow for a gangrenous effect.\nUse the best quality face paint you can find. Cheap, low-quality face paint will not blend well and is bad for your skin. Try to get your hands on some high-quality stage make up - it can usually be found in good costume stores.\n Dark, sunken eyes can help you look dead, violently injured, sleep-deprived, or all of the above!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline your lids with dark pencil eyeliner, then smudge it outward. Then use black or brown eyeshadow or face paint to fill in the dark circles beneath the eyes and around the eyelids.\nBlend around the edges with purple and red paint or shadow to create the illusion of freshly-bruised skin, or with green and yellow for an older looking bruise.\n Zombies are often pretty emaciated looking - good brains can be hard to come by you know! You can achieve this sunken in effect by sucking in your cheeks and lightly blending some black powder or paint into the hollows. This will highlight your cheekbones.\n Apply black lipstick or face paint to your lips for a dried-out, dead look. Also emphasize the creases around your mouth with some dark, shadowy lines.\n Use a small paintbrush to paint thin, zig-zagged lines in blues and purples all over the face to create popping veins. Take a dry stippling sponge (or some other coarse sponge) and dip it in red face paint. Draw the sponge lightly over the skin to create a bloody-looking scratch.\n You can buy fake blood at most costume stores, or you can make your own non-toxic version simply by adding some red food coloring to corn syrup. For all the fake blood you'll ever need, mix one cup of corn syrup with one or two tablespoons of red food coloring. For darker, more realistic looking, you can also add one or two drops of blue food coloring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply the blood to your hairline and let it drip down your face, or cup some blood in your hand and dip your mouth in to make it look like you just fed!\nUse a toothbrush for blood spatter. Put some fake blood onto a toothbrush, aim the bristles at your face, and run your finger over the bristles from bottom to top.\nCreate a dripping blood effect. Dip a sponge into the fake blood and squeeze it over your skin. The blood should run into a natural-looking drizzle.\n Zombie contact lenses - which are typically very pale blue or white - can really up the scare-factor of your costume. Find such contact lenses online or at costume stores.\n The undead aren't particularly concerned with personal hygiene, so washing their hair isn't a priority. If you want your locks to look limp and lifeless, rub a generous amount of conditioner through them. You can do this before or after you apply your makeup.\n\n\nYou can also make your hair look messy and unkempt (for that \"just out-of-the-coffin\" look) by teasing or backcombing the hair using a small comb. Spritz with hairspray to hold in place.\nSprinkle baby powder into your roots to achieve a graying, ashen effect.\n Like the rest of their bodies, zombies' teeth are typically rotting and decayed. Of course, it's possible to buy fake teeth at the costume store, but these can be awkward or uncomfortable to wear and prevent you from talking or eating properly. Overcome this problem by (temporarily) staining your teeth using water mixed with a little brown food coloring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwish the the mixture around your mouth and between your teeth, then spit out. Alternatively, you could use red food coloring for a bloody effect!\nWhen you're done, brush your teeth with a little baking soda to remove the stains and restore your teeth to their original color.\n Perfect zombie make-up should be complemented by an authentic-looking zombie costume. To create a classic zombie costume, get some old dress clothes (second-hand stores are great for this) and do whatever you can to rip and dirty them. Go at them with a scissors, roll them in the mud, give them to the dog to chew on - the scruffier they end up looking, the better.\n\n\nCreate bullet holes in your clothing by making circular marks with black permanent marker, then dribble or splatter fake blood around the edges.\nThe great thing about zombie make-up is that you can wear it with any costume to instantly zombify it. Use your creativity to come up with a zombie version of whatever boring Halloween costume you were originally thinking of -- become a zombie ballerina, a zombie tourist or a zombie pirate!\n\n, Liquid latex is good for achieving a generally deathly look, as well as building up wounds or other facial deformities.\n\n\nYou should be able to find it at seasonal Halloween supply stores, or at beauty supply chains.\nChoose a color that looks appropriately pale and decaying.\n Stretching out your skin as you apply latex ensures that you won't have any accidental blank patches. Additionally, it will leave you with some decidedly creepy wrinkling when the latex dries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGently spread or stretch the area of skin you're painting. It's best to do this technique one area at a time (i.e., forehead, one cheek, chin, etc.).\nUsing a clean paintbrush or makeup sponge, apply a thin layer of liquid latex to the area in small stippling motions. Keep your strokes light and short.\n You can use these techniques to make the face look misshapen, or lay the groundwork for a scabbing \"wound.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply another layer of latex to \"build\" your make up. Creating light layers of latex, instead of smearing on thick amounts, creates even coverage with minimal clumping.\nMix a little bit of uncooked oatmeal with the latex, then apply in one or two small areas on the face. This is great for a gangrenous or scabby look.\nPut single-ply tissue between latex layers. Get a piece of toilet paper, and separate the sheets so that you have a single ply. Rip the edges until you have the shape and size you want. Hold it over an area with a base latex layer already underneath it, and paint another layer over it. It will help disguise the smoothness of your skin with a rotting texture.\n By selectively ripping parts of the liquid latex, you can put wide gashes or small lacerations into your new skin.\n\n\nUse scissors. You should carefully snip the latex until you create the wound you want. Be careful not to nick your skin!\nUse a toothpick. Simply stick it into the liquid latex and drag it through for a gaping wound.\n Dip a clean paintbrush or makeup sponge into fake blood, and gently dab it into your gashes or over your oatmeal portions.\n For the right consistency, use about 1\/3 cup (80mL) of water per packet of gelatin.\n\n\nColor the gelatin.

Store it in a bowl or resealable plastic bag.\n If you heat it to boiling, you'll break down the structure of the gelatin. Put it in a bowl in the microwave and heat in 10-second intervals, until the cubes have softened and become slightly gooey.\n Using a popsicle stick or tongue depressor, glop the gelatin onto the area. As it begins to dry and re-harden, use the stick to pull up small, stretchy threads \u2014\u00a0this will create more texture around the wound.\n If you're still using a makeup sponge on other parts of your face, be careful to steer clear of the gelatin areas.","Prepare your face.\nApply latex or gelatin to create wounds and gashes (optional).\nApply a base of white face paint or stage make-up.\nCreate dark circles around your eyes.\nHollow out your cheeks.\nDarken your lips.\nCreate popping veins and bloody scratches.\nFinish with some fake blood.\nWear creepy zombie contact lenses.\nGet greasy zombie hair.\nStain your teeth.\nCreate the costume.\nPurchase liquid latex.\nUse the \"stretch and stipple\" technique.\nBuild up deformities or wound sites.\nPut wounds or scabs into latex.\nFill your wounds with blood.\nMake gelatin a few hours before.\nGently heat the gelatin.\nApply the gelatin to your face to create raised wounds.\nAllow the gelatin to harden and dry.","How to Apply Zombie Makeup"],["There are several types of endocrine disorders that can impact your dog's hair and skin. These include disorders of the thyroid gland, adrenal gland, and the pituitary gland.Skin and hair problems are also often caused by allergies. If your dog is having issues with its skin and hair, you should consult with a veterinarian about possible causes and solutions.;\n, Endocrine disorders can cause both weight loss and weight gain, depending on what type of disorder your dog has. Problems with the thyroid gland and the adrenal gland can cause your dog to either gain or lose weight. Problems in the pancreas can cause your dog to lose weight.In order to assess whether your dog has lost or gained weight, it's a good idea to have an idea of how much your dog weighs normally. If you know how much the dog weighs on an average day you can easily weigh it to see if it has lost weight.\n While weakness and lethargy can be caused by a wide variety of illnesses, they can be associated with endocrine disorders as well. Pay attention to your dog's energy level and take note if its energy level drops.\n\n\nLethargy and weakness are associated with endocrine disorders in the pancreas, adrenal gland, and the thyroid gland., Endocrine disorders can also cause problems in your dog's digestive system. This usually means your dog will have repeated episodes of vomiting or diarrhea, or both. It may also mean that your dog has less interest in eating than usual because it is not feeling well.\n\n\nDigestive distress can be associated with a wide variety of illnesses. In the case of endocrine disorders, it is usually associated with problems in the pancreas, adrenal gland, or the thyroid gland., If your dog has symptoms that you think could be connected to an endocrine disorder then you should have it looked at by a veterinarian. Call your veterinary office and tell them about your dog's symptoms. They will schedule an appointment for you to bring your dog in.\n\n\nIf your dog is having severe symptoms and you are worried about its survival then you should bring your dog to a veterinarian right away. Call the veterinary office on your way in so that they can prepare for your arrival but don't wait for an open appointment if your dog is gravely ill.\n When you bring your dog in to see a veterinarian, they are likely to ask you a variety of questions about your dog's condition. Give the vet as much information as you can in order to assist them in coming to a thorough diagnosis for your dog.\n\n\nKeep track of your dog's symptoms, even consider writing them down, so that you can tell your veterinarian exactly when you first noticed them and how they have progressed.\n Once your veterinarian has done a thorough physical exam of your dog and has discussed its symptoms with you, he or she may want to do additional testing to figure out what exactly is wrong with the dog. Approve these tests so that your veterinarian can get to the bottom of what is making your dog ill.\n\n\nTesting usually begins with a general blood count and urinalysis. If any levels look off during these tests, then the vet can do follow up tests to narrow down the cause.\nOnce a veterinarian suspects a specific glandular problem, they can do specific tests on that gland's function. For example, if your veterinarian suspects a problem with the thyroid then he or she is likely to do a series of thyroid function tests, testing for T4 and TSH levels., Once your veterinarian figures out what they think is wrong with your dog, they will discuss the problem with you. They will also discuss the treatment and prognosis with you as well. Feel free to ask questions if you don't understand what they are telling you at first.\n\n\nTake notes if you have a hard time remembering details. This will help you to treat and care for your dog later on.\nMake sure that your vet is taking your dog's age into consideration when discussing treatment. You will need to weigh your dog's age and physical stamina against the treatment options your veterinarian presents.\n Medication can often be used to treat endocrine disorders that produce too much hormone. Syndromes that are caused by hormone deficiency are often treated by replacing the missing hormone. The most common example of this type of treatment is insulin injections that are used to treat diabetes. Medications used for endocrine disorders are sometimes injected, as in the case of insulin, but are often given orally. This is the case for steroid and thyroid hormone replacements.\nMedications are often a good treatment option for senior dogs, as undergoing more invasive types of treatment could be too much for their aging bodies.\n If your dog has an endocrine disorder that causes too much hormone to be released then surgery to remove the malfunctioning gland may be one of the treatment options.For example, endocrine problems that are caused by tumors or tissue malformation may require surgery to correct.\n\n\nSurgery can be very hard on senior dogs. You will need to discuss your dog's health and whether or not your vet thinks the dog can physically handle surgery before committing to this treatment. Some senior dogs, depending on their age and condition, are better off living out their days on medication than undergoing surgery even though the surgery could potentially eliminate the problem.\n Radiotherapy is extremely rare as a means of treating endocrine disease in dogs. A medical or surgical intervention is much more likely. However, if your dog has an endocrine disorder that causes too much hormone to be released then it may be able to be treated with radiotherapy. This type of treatment uses radiation to eliminate tissues that are malfunctioning.For example, radioactive iodine can be used to eliminate an overactive thyroid.\nIn many cases, radiotherapy is used on glands that cannot be surgically removed due to location or other restrictions.","Look for skin problems or hair loss.\nIdentify changes in weight.\nPay attention to weakness and lethargy.\nTake note of digestive distress.\nTake your dog to a veterinarian.\nGive the veterinarian as much information as possible.\nApprove blood and urine testing, as well as imaging.\nDiscuss the diagnosis with your veterinarian.\nGive your dog medication.\nSchedule your dog for surgery.\nHave your dog undergo radiotherapy.","How to Diagnose Endocrine Disorders in Senior Dogs"],["Form V is all about redirecting your opponents attacks back at them, and attacking immediately after defending.\n Shien is more useful for fighting blaster-wielding opponents such as droids or bounty hunters.

Take measurements with a measuring tape or ribbon of at least 100 feet (30.5\u00a0m) long of the area you wish to do the fencing on. On a large piece of paper, draw out, using a pencil and a ruler, where you want the fence to be laid out. Accommodate for buildings and shelters that are currently in that area, and also accommodate for the length that each cattle panel is, or the size of cattle panels you wish to get for your new corral. If you have not purchased any panels yet, as you do the drawing, make a list of how many panels (and what size) you will need for your corral.\n\n\nPanels range in size from 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) long to 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m) long; most custom-made ones will be over 25 feet (7.6\u00a0m). long. All are even numbered measurements; you will not get any panels that are an odd-number in length. Most panels will also be measured in Imperial measurements, but may possibly include Metric measurements as well.;\n, With surveyor tape, sticks and\/or bright spray paint, mark the places where you wish to lay your panels down. Remember to keep in mind the general length of the panels you are using. Also keep in mind that the panels won't be touching each other most of the time, as you may have between two to 6 inches (15.2\u00a0cm) of space between the ends of each panel.\n If you haven't done so already, you can now go and buy the cattle panels you need. Your local feed supply store or a livestock-farm equipment provider may have the panels you need. Or, if you know of any locals that are building cattle panels, you can also go and see them and by the panels you need there.\n The smaller panels are easily done by hand. If you want the more temporary panels to be made permanent, pound fence posts in between each panel and use fencing wire to tie each panel to the post. For the much larger (25 ft long) panels, use a tractor with a front-end loader to move them around. Be careful of where the panels swing and where\/how you set them down.\n\n\nDon't panic if area you set up is not following according to the survey lines you created. The animals you keep in there are not going to care about whether the corral is perfect or not. If you are short, adjust the panels accordingly; this is much easier with the temporary ones that have a T-beam on the base (these are called stand-alone panels). For those panels that you want to reinforce with T-posts or wooden fence posts, lay out the panels on their sides first before you do any post-pounding. This is so you can actually see how things are really laid out and whether any adjustments need to be made or not.\n Some of the custom-made panels will have gates pre-attached; other panels will not have this, and may require some extra labour to have any gates installed.\n","Plan.\nMark.\nBuy.\nSet up.\nAttach any gates that are needed to be attached to these panels.\nLet the animals out into the corral once everything is secured, chained up and properly reinforced.","How to Make a Fence With Cattle Panels"],["By taking a moment to think about the situation, you may be able to tell if it is within your control or not.\n\n\nFor example, losing your job because of a bad economy is an example of something you can't control.

Other situations in which adopting a fostered dog is inadvisable include:having a family member with a dog fur allergy\nhaving family members who do not want dogs in the house\nbeing too busy to care for the dog\n\n, If you want to meet your potential fostered dog before filling out any paperwork, you can do so at an adoption event. Adoption events are small festivals where adoptable pets \u2013 including dogs \u2013 get to meet potential owners. Fostered pets are often available through local adoption event.For instance, PetSmart offers four National Adoption Weekend events in the US and Canada. The events are in February, May, September, and November.You can find an adoption event near you using the Petfinder Event Calendar, available online at https:\/\/www.petfinder.com\/calendar.\nOnce you decide you want to adopt a fostered dog you located at an adoption event, you\u2019ll need to fill out the necessary paperwork. There will be an interim period while your paperwork is being processed before the dog is actually placed with you.\n If you want to adopt a fostered dog, you\u2019ll need to complete an extensive questionnaire. This paperwork helps the humane society, animal shelter, or similar agency determine whether you\u2019re qualified to adopt a fostered dog. Questions you might see on the adoption paperwork include:Why do you want to adopt a dog?\nAre you looking for a puppy or an older dog?\nDo you plan on moving soon?\n\n, When you adopt a fostered dog, you\u2019ll have to meet them and their foster family. This will give the foster family a chance to learn more about your character and temperament in order to determine if you\u2019re a good fit for their fostered dog. It will also give you a chance to see if the fostered dog\u2019s temperament and personality are a good match for you.Ask the foster family questions about the fostered dog\u2019s habits and behavior when meeting them. For instance, you might ask if the dog is housetrained, if it chews furniture and books, and if it knows any tricks.\nSchedule a meeting with the foster family and fostered dog you\u2019re interested in as soon as possible. Otherwise, other families might adopt the fostered dog before you.\nYou might be able to reach the foster family by email or phone.\n When you show up to your meet-and-greet, bring a dog collar and leash with you. Since you\u2019ve already been approved by the adoption agency, you should be able to head home to your fostered dog that very day.You\u2019ll have to fill out some paperwork before taking your dog home if you attended an adoption event. You likely won\u2019t be able to take the dog home until your paperwork is processed, even if you\u2019re ahead of anyone else on the adoption list.\n Once you\u2019ve decided to take the dog home, you\u2019ll have a fill out a few more documents. These are much briefer and more limited in scope than the application you initially completed in order to adopt the dog. The documents basically constitute a contract that makes you legally responsible for the health of the fostered dog from that point on.Along with the final adoption paperwork, you\u2019ll need to pay an adoption fee.The adoption fee for a particular organization will vary. Ask a knowledgeable representative of the organization what the adoption fee for your dog will be.","Have prior experience as a dog owner.\nBe able to own a dog.\nAttend adoption events.\nComplete the paperwork.\nMeet the fostered dog you want to adopt.\nBe ready to take the dog home with you.\nComplete adoption paperwork.","How to Adopt a Fostered Dog3"],["It may not always be appropriate to bring up the topic of masturbation with your teenager, depending on your cultural or religious attitudes toward it. In general, it's good to take the opportunity to educate your teen about sexual health and safety, having a general \"birds and the bees\" conversation, but it's not always necessary to discuss masturbation specifically.\n\n\nThere's no one way, and no right way, to approach this issue. On one end of the spectrum, some sex-positive parents might find it appropriate to encourage masturbation, or even give a sex toy to a teenager and talk specifically about the difference between love and sex, while other parents on the other end of the spectrum may find the idea abhorrent.\nAbove all, you need to decide what you're comfortable with and what attitudes and behaviors you want to promote for your teenager as they're coming into adulthood.;\n, According to most recent studies, an improved understanding of masturbation is critical to a comprehensive understanding of healthy adolescent sexual development. Instead of simply telling your teen to stop masturbating, or telling them that masturbation is normal, you should consider helping them understand how it is a part of sexual health and well being. While the conversation might seem awkward, keeping it focused on the following topics will help to alleviate the awkwardness. Take the opportunity to educate your teenager about:\n\n\nHealth and cleanliness\nCommon misconceptions\nModeration\n\n, If the subject of sex is awkward to discuss between parents and teenagers, the subject of masturbation is possibly even more so. It's also a teachable moment and an opportunity to promote health and safety, so it's not necessarily something to ignore. It's important for you to take a step back, relax, and plan what you'll say and how you'll say it.\n\n\nYour reaction to the fact that your teenager is masturbating may form a big impression on your child's body image, the way your child understands sexuality, and the way your child develops into an adult. It's important to keep this in mind.\n There's nothing psychologically or biologically wrong with a teenager who masturbates. In fact, masturbation is a normal part of healthy sexual development. But for some parents, the primary concern, if there is one, with their teenager's masturbation has to do with religious or cultural concerns. If you were raised to think that masturbation is morally wrong, it's still important to put your teenager's health at the fore of the conversation.\n\n\nYou don't have to discuss whether or not masturbation is \"wrong,\" even if you think it is. Instead, focus on cleanliness, pornography, and other tangential topics, to make sure your teenager doesn't develop bad habits.\nMost religious texts do not address the topic of masturbation at all, leaving this form of sexuality in somewhat of a gray area. It's not recommended that you ever make a \"big deal\" of the situation, or attempt to discourage or shame your teenager. Masturbation is extremely common, physically and psychologically normal, and isn't harmful in any way.\n It's likely that your teenager has already heard a lot of urban legends and hearsay about masturbation at school, or among friends. You may have even heard these myths yourself, but aren't sure what is truth and what is fiction. It's important that you learn to distinguish between the facts and the misconceptions if you hope to guide your teenager through this.Masturbation won't lead to blindness, hairy palms, or impotency.\nNocturnal emissions or \"wet dreams\" aren't a form of masturbation and aren't the sign of \"seminal weakness\" or a poor moral character.\nIt's neither true that \"everyone\" or \"nobody\" masturbates. A great many people, men and woman, masturbate regularly, but it's neither necessary for a happy and well-functioning life, nor a roadblock to that life.\n Let the experts do some of this work for you, and consider giving your teenager a book about sexuality as a gift and as a guide. This can be an excellent way of alleviating some of the awkwardness of the conversation, as well as making sure that your teen gets good, sound advice about sexuality at this important stage. All of the following are excellent guides for teen sexuality:\n\n\n\"Changing Bodies, Changing Lives\" by Ruth Bell\n\"Our Bodies, Ourselves\" by Judy Norsigian\n\"S.E.X.: The All-You-Need-To-Know Progressive Sexuality Guide to Get You Through High School and College\" by Heather Corinna\n\"100 Questions You'd Never Ask Your Parents\" by Elisabeth Henderson\n\n, The dinner table with grandma and grandpa isn't the time to bring up a sensitive subject like this. Make the conversation as brief and as painless as possible by doing it in private, at an appropriate and non-serious moment, not when you're feeling flustered because you just found some \"evidence,\" or because you're frustrated.\n\n\nTry to put yourself in your teenager's shoes and anticipate how they'll feel when you bring this up. Many teens feel embarrassed and isolated, feeling as if they're the only person going through this., This may be an embarrassing conversation for your teen, so avoid probing. You don't need to know \"how often\" your teenager is masturbating, or other potentially awkward questions. Focus on what you want your teenager to know and make it relatively simple, and keep it brief. Try leading with the following script:\n\n\n\"I don't want to embarrass you, but you're old enough to talk about sex and masturbation and there are a few things I need you to know, ok?\"\n\n, Nothing about this conversation should communicate that your teenager is in trouble. Use a calm, even, and reassuring tone of voice, the same kind of tone you'd use when discussing household chores or homework. Make it routine.\n\n\nIf you're feeling upset or awkward, acknowledge the situation: \"My parents never talked to me about these things, and I wish they had. I think it's important, even though it's a little awkward.\"\n\n, If you only communicate one thing to your teenager, it should be to reassure them that what they're going through is normal and that they shouldn't feel guilty. Teenagers may be getting extremely mixed messages from their friends at school, and it can be confusing to reconcile their personal urges with what others are saying.\n\n\nTry saying, \"I know what you're going through may be confusing, but you need to know that this is normal, healthy, and you don't need to feel guilty about it.\"\n\n, Another important thing to inform your teenager about is basic safety and cleanliness when it comes to masturbation. When teens are first exploring their bodies, it's possible to wander into risky behavior, and you want to make sure your teenager is informed about what to avoid.\n\n\nFor girls, it's important to encourage the proper washing of hands and toys, appropriate toys or devices, as well as to talk about urinary tract health and sexual activity as a part of a general discussion about sexual health.\nFor boys, it's important to encourage cleanliness during and after masturbation, and to discuss safe practices.\n Just because masturbation is normal and healthy doesn't mean it can't become a problem. Addiction and distraction are potential problems that teenagers face in regard to masturbation, so it's important to encourage moderation.\n\n\nYou don't need to get specific in terms of frequency: some people's sex drives are much higher, while others are much lower. One isn't right or wrong. Still, it's important to reinforce the idea that masturbation shouldn't get in the way of a healthy social life, other normal teenage activities, and responsibilities like school work.It's also important to encourage moderation in terms of physical sensations. Teenagers need to be gentle with their own bodies as their sexuality develops, taking care to avoid injury, but practicing healthy sexuality.\nAll teens must become accustomed to controlling and understanding sexual desires, distinguishing lust from love.\n The best thing that you can offer your teenager at this stage is an open door. Make yourself available for questions, and endeavor to answer those questions as openly and honestly as possible, without making things too awkward. Don't press the issue, if your teen isn't interested in talking more, make sure to end the conversation by letting your child know that you're always happy to talk.\n If your child has reached sexual maturity, they will benefit from having a conversation about masturbation. You don't \"need proof\" and you don't need to snoop through your child's private life, inspect their sheets and undergarments, or dig around on their computer browser history to have a good idea that your teenager is probably masturbating, or at least experiencing an upswing in hormone production that has thrown their sex drive into high gear.\n There's no reason to punish masturbation, unless you're concerned that a teenager has developed an addiction, in which case you should probably seek professional guidance. Doing this can be confusing and traumatic for teenagers, and it's best avoided.\n Remember that education is different from setting rules. Often, when someone has enough of the right information, they can set their own rules. This may be a good learning experience for many teens. If you choose to sit down with your teen and talk about this issue, remember that simple education can can make a positive influence on your teenager.\n Some teenagers will be mortified at the thought of talking to a parent about masturbating, and that's understandable. It's an intensely private behavior that's not common to discuss in any situation. If you feel you must bring it up for the safety and health of your teenager, do so, but also recognize when it's time to draw the line and end the conversation, short of awkward specifics.\n\n\nDon't snoop after what you suspect to be fact, and don't feel the need to make remarks when you notice your teen lingering in the bathroom during a shower. If you've done your job and had the conversation, leave it alone.\nIf you feel you must, or feel your teenager has a masturbation problem, address it by limiting your teen's time alone and restricting Internet access if necessary.","Decide whether or not to address the issue.\nTake the opportunity to educate.\nPut yourself in your teenager's shoes.\nTemper your cultural or religious concerns.\nCorrect common misconceptions about masturbation.\nConsider giving your teen a book as a gift.\nSet aside some time to talk in private.\nBe as straightforward as possible.\nUse a gentle tone of voice.\nReassure your teenager.\nTalk about cleanliness and safety.\nEncourage moderation.\nBe available for questions.\nDon't \"look for evidence.\",\nDon't punish masturbation.\nDon't discourage.\nDon't overdo it.","How to Talk to Your Teenager about Masturbation"],["Seeking professional help can give you an important outlet for understanding why you\u2019re crying in certain situations.

Asparagus season peaks in early to mid-spring. That's when you'll find the most flavorful, crunchy asparagus that will freeze well and still taste good when it thaws.\n\n\nLook for green, fresh-looking asparagus. Pick it up. If it's floppy, it's no longer fresh. The spears should be firm and crunchy.\nChoose thick spears, rather than a thin-speared variety. Thick spears hold up better in the freezer.\nA farmer's market is a great place to shop for fresh asparagus that's good to freeze. Avoid supermarket asparagus that was flown in from other countries.;\n, Run each spear under cold water to wash away dirt, grit and other impurities. Make sure no traces of grime remain on the asparagus before proceeding.\n Asparagus tends to get tough and woody at the bottom end. It's necessary to trim off the bottom third or so of each spear. Use a knife to trim the spear. You can also break each spear by hand by feeling for the weak spot near the bottom third of the asparagus and snapping it in two. Repeat with each spear.\n If you already know that you'll be using asparagus pieces in soups and casseroles, it's fine to chop the spears into one or two-inch pieces. You may also freeze the spears whole if you prefer.Try to make all the pieces uniform in size so they blanch and freeze evenly.\nIf you're leaving the spears whole, sort them into piles according to size. Blanch like-sized spears together.\n Choose a pot that can easily hold the asparagus pieces or spears you're blanching. Fill it 2\/3 full with water. Bring the water to a rolling boil.\n While the water is coming to a boil, fill a large bowl with ice cubes and water. You'll need to plunge the asparagus into the ice bath to stop it from overcooking after you finish the blanching.\n Place the asparagus pieces or spears into the boiling water. Set a timer for three minutes and let the asparagus cook. When the time is up, remove the asparagus from the boiling water immediately.You can add up to a pound of asparagus at a time to the water. If you have more than a pound, blanch it in batches.\nIf you have several piles of asparagus cut to different sizes, blanch each pile separately.\nIf your asparagus is exceptionally thick or thin, adjust the cooking time accordingly. Thin asparagus (thinner than a pencil) should be blanched for about two minutes, while thick asparagus (thicker than a marker) should be blanched for four.\n Place the blanched asparagus in the ice bath immediately after removing it from the boiling pot of water. Let it sit in the ice bath for three minutes, or the exact same amount of time it spent getting cooked.\n Transfer the asparagus to a dry towel and pat the pieces dry. If you don't dry the asparagus thoroughly, the asparagus will get frosty in the freezer. Work quickly so that you can freeze the asparagus as soon as possible and so you can avoid mushy asparagus., Arrange the pieces in one even layer so that no pieces overlap. Cover the baking sheet with a piece of plastic wrap.\n\n\nSkip this step if you don't mind if the asparagus sticks together. Just place the asparagus into a freezer-safe container and freeze.\n Place the covered baking sheet in the freezer to \"flash freeze\" for one hour. This helps the pieces freeze individually, rather than freezing into a solid mass in the freezer storage container.\n Use bags or plastic bins that are safe for long-term storage. Label the containers with the date so you'll know how long the asparagus is safe to eat.Pack the asparagus tightly to remove as much air as possible from the storage container. This preserves the asparagus' taste and texture as much as possible.\nVacuum storage is a good option for freezing asparagus. It removes all the air from the packaging.\n After a year, the asparagus will begin to deteriorate in taste and texture.

If it\u2019s not thick enough after a night, drain off some liquid or add in more chia by the teaspoonful., Add the Cinnamon, Chocolate, or Ginger (powder or juice) flavors. Slowly pour the flavors in while mixing. If there are lumps, take them out and mash them with the bottom of your spoon. This will separate the lump into pieces that you can place back into the mixture., Leave overnight again to let the powders and flavors dissolve into the pudding., You may have to add more powder to get your desired level of flavor, but since the initial powders have melted into the pudding, just mix it well into the finished pudding., The skin should not be wrinkled or dark brown. It should look fat and juicy and have no mold. Squeeze the piece to see how dense and firm it is.

Some plastic slinky kinks can be molded back into place when heated, but this won't always work and could even melt your toy if you're not careful. Metal slinkies are much harder to bend back, so only try it if you have time to spare and really don't want to buy a replacement.\n Fill a pot with enough water to cover the slinky. Heat it on the stove alone, without the slinky in it.You do not want the water to boil, but keep heating it until it becomes quite hot, perhaps just beginning to steam.\n\n\nYou could microwave a bowl of water instead, or heat water in the kettle and pour it into a pot.\n Turn off the heat once the water is hot. Never keep heating the water after the slinky is in it, or the slinky could melt and ruin both itself and the container it's in.\n Put on rubber gloves to protect your hands, and lower the slinky into the hot water. Leave it there for a couple minutes.\n After a couple minutes in the hot water, take the slinky out while wearing gloves. If the slinky was heated hot enough, you should be able to mold it gently into place, pressing the kinked coil down where it should go.\n\n\nIf you have a cardboard tube or other cylinder that's slightly smaller than the slinky, you can wrap the slinky coils around it to get the right position., If the slinky is still stiff and can't be bent, heat the water hotter and try again. Heating the slinky too much can make it a permanently ruined mess, so increase the temperature slowly and keep a close eye on the water. Never heat the slinky directly.\n Immediately after bending it back into place, place the coiled slinky underneath a flat book. Leave it there for several hours, or even overnight, to compress the slinky into position.\n\n\nIf the book keeps falling off, try using a large, thin children's book instead. Place a small, heavy object on the center of the children's book, directly over the slinky.\nDon't use a book that's so heavy or so wide that it knocks the slinky over and crushes it.\n If hot water doesn't work to repair the slinky, you could line a baking sheet with tin foil, put the kinked slinky in a stack on top of it and heat it in a 250\u00baF (121\u00baC) oven for about 10 minutes.Use oven mitts to pull it out and bend it back into place, if it hasn't settled on its own. This is risky, as some plastic slinkies could melt.\n If all else fails, use a pair of wire cutters to cut the slinky at either end of the kink. You can try to reattach the good parts using rubber cement or super glue, but it will be difficult to attach them at the right angle. More likely, you'll end up with two permanently separated smaller slinkies.\n\n\nThe cut ends may be sharp. Try covering them with several small pieces of packing tape to protect your fingers.","Know your chances for plastic or metal slinkies.\nHeat a pot of water.\nTurn off the heat.\nWhile wearing gloves, put the slinky into the hot water.\nRemove the slinky and bend it into place.\nTry again with hotter water if you didn't succeed.\nPress the slinky flat with a book.\nHeat the slinky in an oven.\nCut the slinky apart.","How to Fix a Slinky3"],["You may not even need to hire a lawyer for your divorce. Most divorces, especially if there are no children involved and neither party contests anything, don't require an adversarial legal process.Consider using an experienced mediator instead. The mediator will work with you and your spouse to come up with a division of assets agreeable to both parties. After the assets have been divided, you and your spouse can file for divorce on your own.\nIn many states spousal support, child support, and asset divisions follow rigid guidelines. You can calculate them with simple and inexpensive programs that can serve as the basis for mediation.;\n, Reduce the fear and the perception of the need to \u201clegal up.\u201d Try to mutually agree not to take any steps that will materially affect either of your financial situations without giving each other notice and reasonable time to respond.\n\n\nEven if you do decide to retain a lawyer, the process of divorce will be much easier if you try to cooperate with your spouse.\n When creating your list, include the attorney\u2019s name, address, phone number, and website address. You can find nearby divorce attorneys by:Looking in your local yellow pages. Check your yellow pages under \u201cattorney\u201d then searching for ads that list divorce or family law as an area in which the attorney(s) practices.\nRunning a search of an online phone directory.\nUsing your favorite search engine to run an online search.

If you live in California, for example, you would want to search \u201cfamily law attorneys in California.\u201d\nVisiting your state bar association\u2019s website or calling and asking for a referral. Check to see if your state bar association certifies attorneys as specialists in family law. To locate your local bar association website, visit the website for the American Bar Association., You may be able to eliminate some lawyers from your list by looking at other people\u2019s recommendations (to hire or not to hire) and referrals. A few ways to gather referrals and recommendations include:Talking to friends and family. Talk to friends and family members who have used a divorce lawyer. Find out who they hired, if they were happy with the services, and why or why not. Ask if they would recommend the attorney.\nChecking online reviews. Many websites offer free reviews of lawyers. Find Law is one of the many great resources you can use for this purpose.Looking at disciplinary records. State bar associations keep public records about complaints and disciplinary actions taken against attorneys licensed to practice in the state. You can find your bar association\u2019s website by selecting your state from the State & Local Bar Associations page provided by the American Bar Association.\n You can narrow your list further by thoroughly reviewing the website of each attorney on your list. Some things that you want to look for include:\n\n\nInformation about divorce law. Look for some general information about divorce and family law, a frequently asked questions (\u201cFAQ\u201d) section, or a blog with articles pertaining to family law. The best attorneys will have well developed websites offering a lot of information.\nGrammar and spelling. If you see a lot of grammar and spelling errors, maybe that attorney is not for you. An attorney should use proper grammar and a spell check, or ensure that those writing content for his or her website can.\nBackground information on the attorney. Most lawyers\u2019 websites will provide information about each attorney working for the firm. Take a look at each lawyer\u2019s educational background and work history. You should look for a divorce attorney who has at least three-to-five years of experience doing family law and who spends at least 50% of his or her time doing divorce work.\n Another easy step to narrow your list is by specialization within the umbrella of divorce law. Many state bar associations have certified specialists in family law. If you find an attorney who appears to have a specialization, only consider the attorney if you fall within the category that the lawyer usually handles.For example, if you find an attorney whose website is titled something like \u201cDad\u2019s Divorce Central,\u201d you would not want to engage the attorney unless you were a father getting a divorce.\n Contact each of the attorneys remaining on your list and set up a consultation. Most attorneys do consultation appointments for free, but some may charge a small fee for a consultation.\n\n\nExpect to pay about $50 when the lawyer does have a consultation fee.\nIf you cannot afford a consultation fee, contact other attorneys. Most will offer free consultations.\n As you make appointments, the attorneys will likely request specific documentation regarding your case. Get these documents together ahead of time to be sure that you can locate them on the day of the appointment.\n You have a limited amount of time with each lawyer, so ask questions that will give you a good sense of the attorney\u2019s experience. Some initial questions you should ask include:\n\n\n\u201cHow long have you been practicing family law?\u201d You should look for someone who has practiced for at least three years.\n\u201cHow many divorce cases do you handle per year?\u201d You want to hire someone who spends at least 50% of his or her time doing divorce work.\n\u201cDo you know the domestic relations judges in the area?\u201d Knowing the judges who will handle your case is a plus - the judges will be more likely to like the lawyer and trust what he or she says.\n\u201cDo you know my spouse?\u201d You do not want to hire someone who has a personal or professional relationship with your spouse.\n To get a sense of how an attorney would proceed with your case, make sure to ask some pointed questions during your consultation. Some questions you should ask include:\n\n\n\u201cWhat is your strategy for my case?\u201d\n\u201cHow long do you think it will take to complete my case?\u201d\n\u201cHow much property do you think I will be able to get?\u201d\n\n, To get a sense of how easy it will be to reach your attorney and how closely he or she will be working with your case, ask some pointed questions about these details. Some questions you should ask include:\n\n\n\u201cHow easy is it to reach you by phone?\u201d\n\u201cWill anyone else in your office be working on my case?\u201d\n\u201cHow will my case be covered when you are in court or away from the office for other reasons?\u201d\n\n, To get an idea of how much the services of your attorney will cost, you should prepare to ask some direct questions about the costs of his or her services. Some questions you should ask include:\u201cHow much do you charge for anything else other than your time?\u201d\n\u201cWhat expenses do you pay from the money I pay you and what expenses do I have to pay directly?\u201d\n\u201cUnder what circumstances do you refund all or part of my retainer fee?\u201d\n\n, When you meet with an attorney for your consultation, ask all of the questions that you have decided to ask. You may also want to bring a notepad and paper to make notes about the attorney\u2019s answers and also note your general thoughts on the attorney.\n If your particular issue is complicated or extremely rare, it is possible that the attorneys you interview will have to research the specifics of domestic relations law in your state and how they would apply to your case.\n\n\nDo not assume that the attorney is a bad choice or that the attorney is not knowledgeable if he or she cannot answer your question right away. Instead, assess the attorney\u2019s answers to the other questions you asked.\n Some attorneys may attempt to take over the conversation and steer it where they want it to go. If you are comfortable with that, it is fine. If not, try to redirect the conversation to the topics that you want to discuss.\n\n\nTo redirect the conversation, politely say, \u201cI am interested in hearing more about that, but first I want to ask a few more questions.\u201d\n\n, Consider whether or not the attorney answered your questions the way you had hoped or expected. If the attorney\u2019s answers were way off from what you thought they should be, then that is a good sign that this attorney may not be the best fit for your case.\n It is important to have a good relationship with your attorney so that you feel comfortable enough to trust them with personal information for your case. If you just don\u2019t like the person, that is a good sign that you should not hire that person as your attorney., If the divorce is not complicated and will not be drawn out (i.e., if you and your spouse agree on most things), you can usually negotiate a flat-fee arrangement with your attorney. A flat fee is where you pay the attorney an agreed upon price for the whole divorce, regardless of the actual number of hours the attorney spends.If you think that your divorce will be contentious or if you and your spouse have lots of property that must be split up, your lawyer may want to charge you by the hour. Here, the lawyer probably assumes that the case will take more time and effort and therefore he or she will want to make sure the compensation is in line with the amount of time spent.\nIf you think that you will struggle with paying an attorney, check out: How to Hire a Lawyer When You Have Low Income.\n Aside from experience and strong knowledge of family law, choose an attorney with whom you think you will get along and like working. If more than one attorney has the qualifications you are looking for, you should choose the one with whom you feel most comfortable.\n\n\nIf the attorney makes you uncomfortable in any way or seems dismissive of your case or your situation, you should choose someone different to represent you.","Decide whether you need an attorney.\nGive yourself (and your spouse) time.\nCreate a list of local divorce attorneys.\nNarrow your list.\nReview each attorney\u2019s website.\nLook for specialization within divorce law.\nMake an appointment with each of the remaining lawyers on your list.\nGather the relevant information and documents.\nPrepare to ask questions about the attorney\u2019s experience.\nPrepare to ask questions related to your specific situation.\nPrepare to ask questions that will help you assess the attorney\u2019s availability to work on your case.\nPrepare to ask questions about costs.\nAsk your questions.\nBe aware that the attorneys you interview may not have answers to all of your questions.\nKeep control of the conversation.\nReflect on the attorney\u2019s answers to your questions.\nThink about whether or not you have a chemistry with the attorney.\nConsider cost in your decision.\nChoose an attorney.","How to Choose the Right Divorce Lawyer"],["Women come in all shapes and sizes, so successfully pulling off a male-to-female gender transformation will depend on your body type and your target body type.\n\n\nPick a role model to emulate, somebody who has the same general body type as you\u2014tall, short, thick, or thin. If you start from the same basic place as your role model, you'll do well. By using a role model, you will also have a pattern for walking, moving, dressing, and speaking.\n;\n, Our first impression of somebody's gender is based largely on their shape, to the point where it's almost instinctive. Guys generally have smaller hips and butts than women. Not only that, there's not much going on up front, either. So the first thing to do is fix those bits.\n Nothing says \"female\" more than having lady lumps. Entire industries, from garments to cosmetic surgery to publishing empires, have been built on the foundation of our fascination for breasts. For convincing cross dressing, this will be help bring you where you want to be, both physically and emotionally.\n\n\nOne way to do this is to purchase a bra and stuff it with either tissue paper or socks. If you're not interested in showing cleavage, this will work well. If you want cleavage as well as natural-looking bounce, weight, feel, and movement, you can purchase a breast form, which is a prosthesis you wear inside the bra or attached to your body.\nIf you're going for a natural look, don't exaggerate the size of your breasts\u2014make them proportional to your body size, or even a little smaller.\n You want to look the part, but naturally, guys just don't have the curves that women have. It's nature, but mother nature can be fooled!\n\n\nTo achieve a more feminine look, you can use waist-cinching undergarments or corsets to achieve a more hourglass figure. You can also add padded panties, or silicon butt pads to bump the badonkadonk.\nTuck and tape the boys. While there is expensive underwear that can disappear your package faster than a fly-by-night delivery service, you an also do this easily and cheaply with a pair of panty hose and some tape (medical tape, not duct tape\u2014please, for your own sake!) Visit this wikiHow article on How to Tuck and Tape for more information.\n Your facial features say a lot about your gender, and there are measurable physical differences between the two. You will want to imply higher cheekbones and a smaller chin, and of course, you will want to shave very closely.\n\n\nAs women throughout the ages have discovered, the right kind of contouring makeup can create an entirely different facial look. You can create illusions that make features looks smaller or more pronounced and you can even draw focus to certain feminine or masculine traits.\nFeminine face: To get those higher cheek bones, larger eyes, smaller noses, and bigger lips that are strong gender cues, use contouring powder and highlighter.\nAdd makeup to mask or modify your features to appear more feminine. Apply false lashes, mascara, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner and lipstick to create the ultimate feminine look.\n While you can grow out your hair to naturally get the look of the opposite sex, you can also take advantage of wigs to create that look temporarily, and try out different looks and colors to find one that suits you. Look online at celebrities to find the right hairdo for your new features.\n Get the right fit by trying on your clothes that match your figure. You don't want to buy a dress only to find out it doesn't fit with your new cleavage. Take your measurements to determine your needs:\n\n\nYour chest is measured with the tape snug under your arms and above the cups of your bra.\nMeasure your bust across the fullest part of your bra cups. Don't pull the tape too tight\u2014you don't want to squish things down unnaturally here.\nMeasure your waist at the narrowest part, between the top of the hipbone and the bottom of your rib cage.\nYour hips are measured at the largest part of your butt and hips.\nA rule of thumb when buying a dress is to use the largest of the measurements for your dress size.\n It's more than just how a man dresses or a woman does her make up that makes them identifiable with that gender. There are dozens of little differences, red flags that signal that you are a cross dresser. If you are looking for the obvious cross-dressing look, you can skip pass these tips. If you want to look like a woman down to the smallest details, read on!\n\n\nExposed body hair: Men and women expose body hair differently. Waxing, using panty hose or shaving can turn a man into a more realistic woman. Eyebrows are key as well, and sculpted eyebrows will go a long way towards a convincing look. It will also be one of the more noticeable features when you're not cross-dressed, which might be a concern.\nNails: This is an obvious, but a sometimes overlooked detail. Give yourself a manicure to achieve the look you want.\nAccessories: Belts, necklaces and earrings aren't unisex. Keep your accessory shopping to the women's departments.\n Being a cross dresser may be all about the aesthetics to you. If so, the following tips may not mean much. But if you want to pull off the entire gender persona, its important to have the right act down.\n\n\nDevelop the personality. In reality, women have all sorts of behavior patterns--but certain ones are emphasized in females. Women are taught to be less aggressive, for example. They are also allowed to be more emotional than male counterparts.\nFor example, a woman would be more likely at a restaurant to say, \"I would like a salad, please,\" instead of \"I want the salad.\"\nWomen tend to show more emotion. Men are generally taught to avoid a lot of visible emotion, while a woman tends to be allowed to.\nAlter your voice. For starters, you can bring the pitch of your voice up higher to convey a feminine voice. It's also important to also adopt the vocabulary associated with the fairer sex. Note that speaking in a falsetto voice will not be convincing for long. Learn to speak in a softer, more sing-song way, varying your pitch and volume more than you do when speaking as a man.\nWalk the walk. Men and women often walk differently, and a lot of it is taught by culture. Your movement is ingrained, and you've learned to \"walk like a man\" since you were a boy. Women have to learn to walk in a feminine way, which emphasizes grace rather than power. As a man, you have to switch gears.\nPractice walking in heels. Nothing looks less feminine than tottering on high heels. Even if you do not go out in public in heels high heels teach balance, smaller stride, walking softly, and a feminine gait. Practice going up and down stairs especially. Being fully proficient with heels means being able to not only walk, but dance in this type of footwear.\nWomen often walk faster and use their arms more, so try picking up the pace, and engaging your arms. Arms are soft, not hard and stiff.\nAs the song says, \"hips don't lie,\" so sway your hips subtly, but don't do it to the point of exaggeration.\nBe careful to walk with gentleness. Men are allowed to clomp down the hall and pound down stairs in a way that women are not. Women are taught to walk more carefully with a grace. Walk up and down stairs with a skirt, and keep in mind a woman cannot bring her knees up very high.\nAs with all things in cross-dressing, over- exaggeration will not make you look more feminine, it will just make you look more like a guy wearing a dress.","Pick a theme.\nAlter your shape.\nSay hello to the girls.\nCurves ahead.\nContour your face.\nDo your hair up.\nDress the part.\nPay attention to the smaller details.\nGet the attitude.","How to Crossdress1"],["Schnauzers are known to be friendly companions who take well to training from their owners. They are usually said to be good with children, other pets, and even enjoy time alone. They love to play and interact with their family.Their small size makes them suitable for apartment life, but their energetic personalities also make them great dogs for owners with a lot of land to roam.;\n, Every breed of dog, especially purebred ones, has its own set of medical possibilities that the breed is more prone to. Spend some time reading about schnauzers and their medical history to figure out if this is the kind of dog for you.Schnauzers are typically more often affected by eye cataracts than other breeds. This can eventually lead to blindness in old age.\nSchnauzers also are prone to urinary stones, pancreatitis, diabetes, and kidney disease.\nConsult a veterinarian about specific problems affecting schnauzers to get all the information. Ask good questions to fully prepare yourself.\nConsider if you can afford pet insurance to protect yourself from the cost of expensive veterinary treatments.\n Schnauzers aren\u2019t the highest maintenance type of dogs, but they do have a lot of energy. A schnauzer will require some significant exercise and vigorous play time from you as their owner.If you want a lapdog, a schnauzer will be happy to accommodate this, but they will also need to be exercised regularly.\nTry to give your schnauzer between 30 minutes and one hour of exercise every day.\nSchnauzers will also need to be groomed regularly, which is another time consideration. Their coats get matted easily, so they need to be brushed often or taken to the groomers.\n When you decide to adopt a schnauzer, you should decide if you want an adult dog or a puppy. If you want to adopt a schnauzer, it will probably be easier to find an adult dog to adopt, but there may be some puppies available if you are willing to spend some time searching.\n\n\nAn adult dog will be less work than a puppy. They may already be housetrained and will have probably outgrown the puppy tendency to chew things up. They will probably have a calmer temperament and be less active.\nPuppies sure are cute, but they also require a lot of time and energy. They will need more exercise than an older dog and more attention to ensure they don\u2019t pee in the house or tear up your belongings. They\u2019ll need to be housetrained and trained in obedience and require a lot of attention.\n There are many schnauzer rescue agencies across the country that specialize in finding homes for this particular breed of dog. Search the internet for agencies near you and look at their listings for schnauzers currently in their care that are available for adoption.Try searching on adoptapet.com, petfinder.com, or Schnauzer Love Rescue, Inc., Once you find a schnauzer that you would like to adopt, you\u2019ll need to fill out the adoption application with a perspective rescue agency. They will ask questions about your home, what kind of dog you\u2019re interested in, and how much time you can devote to a dog.The application process will help the agency match you with a dog that is the right fit for you.\n Most rescue agencies will require references with their application. These should come from a veterinarian or a close friend who can attest to your ability to care for a dog. If you have an existing veterinarian, ask them to write the letter so they can tell the agency about your past history as a pet owner.Some applications may require a reference from a veterinarian, so be sure to check that before you ask someone else to write your reference letter.\n If you are adopting from a rescue agency, you will likely have to pay an application\/adoption fee. This fee is usually applied to any vet bills the agency had to pay for routine shots, medical treatment, or just for day-to-day care of the dog.Application fees are usually around $300, depending on the agency.\n Once you submit your application, it can take several weeks for a decision to be reached. The agency must ensure that you will be a suitable owner for the schnauzer in question. Don\u2019t call the agency a million times. They will contact you when they have reached a decision.\n A new dog requires a lot of supplies.

Usually, the scale is a comparison to another food, such as pure glucose.Carbohydrates are ranked according to the way that they affect an individual\u2019s blood glucose levels. The higher a food's glycemic index, the more it affects blood sugar and insulin levels. When the carbohydrates in a food cause a person\u2019s blood sugar to spike, it is considered a high-glycemic food. Low-glycemic foods do not have a significant effect on blood sugar, and foods that fall somewhere in the middle are considered moderate-glycemic foods.GI is actually measured by feeding the food to 10 healthy adults (who had fasted) and checking their blood sugar periodically. The GI is based on the averages.;\n, This scale is primarily meant to help people with diseases like diabetes. Utilizing the glycemic index is very helpful for women suffering from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome too, as these women typically have insulin resistance. This causes the woman's body to resist the effects of insulin, causing prolonged blood sugar spikes and eventually diabetes. Following a low-glycemic index diet can significantly lower blood sugar spikes in these individuals. It is also helpful for people who want to lower their carbohydrate intake or who want to lose weight., Because low-glycemic foods are absorbed more slowly, they help you feel fuller for longer. Therefore, they help control your appetite., Many factors can affect a food's GI. For instance, processing can increase a food's GI, such as a grape, which has a lower GI, compared to grape juice, which has a higher GI.Other factors that can affect the GI are how long you cook the food (pasta that is cooked longer has a higher GI), the type (some types of rice have a higher GI than others), and how ripe a piece of fruit is., GI numbers are only assigned to foods that have carbohydrates in them.Therefore, foods such as oil or meat do not have a GI number., Generally, foods that are rated 55 or less are considered low-glycemic foods, while medium foods are in the 56 to 69 GI range. Anything above that is considered high., The easiest way to find low-glycemic foods is to check glycemic indexes. They will offer you a wide variety of low-glycemic foods., Whole grains fall into the category of \"complex carbohydrates,\" and they almost always have a lower GI than more processed varieties. Whole wheat varieties of bread and pasta, oatmeal, muesli, barley, and lentils all have low GIs.Beans are also low on the glycemic scale. For instance, black beans, navy beans, and kidney beans all come in at about 30., Though a couple of fruits rank higher on the GI scale, eating fruits and non-starchy vegetables are usually a safe bet for low-glycemic foods.For instance, watermelon, grapes, and bananas rank relatively high at 72, 59, and 62, respectively.Grapefruit, apples, peaches, pears, and oranges all rank below 50. Grapefruit comes in at the lowest at 25., The more processed your food is, the more likely it is to have a higher GI.Of course, this rule applies to foods like whole wheat bread versus white bread, but it also applies to foods like whole fruit versus fruit juices., If you prefer hot or cold cereal for breakfast, pick one that incorporates or is mainly whole grains, such as oatmeal. You can also find a number of cold cereals that are composed of whole grains. Try topping it with a low-glycemic fresh fruit, such as peaches., These foods, such as instant rice often have a higher GI, so stick to foods you cook yourself.Instead of instant rice, cook brown rice or converted long grain rice for yourself, both of which have lower GIs., For instance, choose whole wheat bread instead of white bread. Try whole wheat pasta instead of regular pasta. These choices will help lower the GI of the foods you eat.You can use these foods the same as you always do, in moderation of course.\n For instance, instead of eating a package of chips, try snacking on a handful of nuts. Instead of cookies, eat a piece of fruit as a snack.Hummus is also very low on the scale and loaded with protein. Eat with some low-glycemic vegetables, such as celery or bell pepper., Foods with more fiber have a lower GI-index. Read labels to help you decide if foods have enough fiber. You need 25 to 30 grams per day.Whole grains are typically higher in fiber, thus allowing for better blood sugar regulation. The higher the fiber content in food, the less impact it will have on blood sugar.\n Even when eating low-glycemic foods, you should combine those foods with low-fat proteins such as fish. This combination helps you feel fuller longer and lowers the GI for the meal., Foods that carry a high-glycemic index rank at 70 or above on the glycemic index.\n\n\nLearn about low-glycemic foods (0-55) that can replace high-glycemic foods in some of your favorite recipes, such as subbing zucchini noodles for regular noodles. By substituting the healthier glycemic option, you will find that you can still enjoy many of your favorite dishes without causing a spike in your blood sugar levels.\nFor moderate glycemic index foods, eliminate anything that ranks between 56 and 69 that you can do without. Keep only the foods that you must have, and consume them in moderation. Continue to enjoy your favorite foods by eating them in their healthiest form. For example, substitute a fresh peach for a cup of canned peaches.\n Fruits and vegetables are high in fiber and thus, have a minimal impact on blood sugar. Focus on fruits that have skins\/seeds, such as berries. These are highest in fiber and pack the best nutritional punch. Vegetables are all highly fibrous, but cruciferous vegetables are especially beneficial. At mealtimes, make sure at least half of your meal is fruits and non-starchy vegetables. Try a fresh, green salad with vegetable toppings, such as bell pepper, cucumber, and tomato, or eat a light mix of fresh peaches, pears, and apples.","Understand what the glycemic index is.\nKnow who it helps.\nEat low-glycemic foods to feel full.\nUnderstand what affects the glycemic index.\nKnow what foods the glycemic index applies to.\nLearn what constitutes a low-glycemic food.\nCheck a glycemic index for low-glycemic foods.\nFocus on whole grains.\nEat your fruits and non-starchy vegetables.\nStick to less-processed foods.\nPick a whole grain for breakfast.\nSkip instant foods.\nPick whole grains over more processed foods.\nSkip packaged foods as snacks.\nFocus on fiber-rich foods.\nEat protein with carbohydrates.\nEliminate foods that carry a high-glycemic load.\nIncorporate fruits and non-starchy vegetables at every meal.","How to Eat Foods Low on the Glycemic Index"],["If your pet has access to the outdoors or is house trained, asking one or more friends and family members to stop by in the morning, afternoon, and evening to feed your dog and take it for a walk may be adequate.

The non-custodial parent must pay support until the child is 18 or graduates high school, whichever is later.\n\n\nChild support is calculated as a percentage of the non-custodial parent\u2019s net income. The percentage is 20% for one child and then an additional 5% for each additional child (up to 40% for five or more children). Net income includes wages, salary, tips, and self-employed income; rental income; retirement and disability income, as well as any alimony.

Paternity can be established by presumption, by voluntary acknowledgement, or by court order.\n\n\nA man is presumed to be the father when he is married to the child\u2019s mother when the child was born, was married to the mother at any point during the 300 days before the child was born, married the mother after the child was born and voluntarily claimed paternity of the child with the Vital Statistics Unit, or continuously lived with the child for the first two years of the child\u2019s life and held the child out as his own.If a man signs a legal form, swearing that he is the father, then he will be treated as the legal father if the mother also signs the acknowledgement.However, if there is also a \u201cpresumed\u201d father, then the presumed father must sign a Denial of Paternity form.Paternity can also be determined by a court. You will initiate the suit by filing a Petition to Adjudicate Parentage. Then you must serve the petition on the man you believe is the father. The man may ask for a DNA test if he denies parentage.You can find the forms at this website.\n You must file a motion for child support in the county where the child lives.

The other parent may agree to waive service. He or she will have to fill out a waiver of service form to that effect. This form must be signed in front of a notary at least one day after you file the petition. The other parent may also waive service simply by answering the petition.By personal service.

Box 12017, Austin, TX 78711-2017.\n Child support payments may be made periodically (weekly, biweekly, or monthly) or in a lump sum. The court may also require the non-custodial parent to purchase an annuity or set aside property. Periodic payments, if ordered, will be made to the state\u2019s Child Support State Disbursement Unit, who then forwards payments to the custodial parent.Custodial parents can receive payments by direct deposit into a bank account or onto their Texas Debit Card.The judge will set the start date for payments. The judge may also order retroactive child support payments for the period of time between the parents separating and the date a formal child support order is entered.Whether or not retroactive child support is ordered will depend on a variety of factors, including whether or not the father knew of his paternity, the resources of the non-custodial parent, and the non-custodial parents contributions to the food, shelter, and clothing of the child before the child support action was filed., If child support payments have not been made in full, then the non-custodial parent is in \u201carrears.\u201d The custodial parent can initiate an enforcement action by filing a Motion to Enforce. Your court may have printed \u201cfill in the blank\u201d forms for you to use. Ask the court clerk.\n\n\nIf no form is available, then you should have an attorney draft a motion or draft one yourself. A motion for enforcement of child support must identify the order violated, state the manner of noncompliance, and state relief requested.You must also include the amount owed, the amount the non-custodial parent has paid, and the amount of arrearages.You must sign your motion or have your attorney sign., Instead of filing your own motion for enforcement, you can contact the Attorney General, whose Child Support Division (CSD) will bring an enforcement action on your behalf. You should work through CSD especially if the non-custodial parent has moved out of state, as CSD can work with agencies in the other state to get payment for you.\n\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s office can also help track down a missing parent. To facilitate this process, provide the Child Support Division with the non-custodial parent\u2019s Social Security Number.The fee is $25 to use the Attorney General\u2019s Child Support Division services.Given how stressful enforcing a child support order can be, you may want to have the state prosecute your enforcement action for you.\n If you draft your own motion, you need to file it in the court which issued the initial child support order. You should attach a copy of the original child support order as well as the history of support payments, which you can get from the Disbursement Unit.\n\n\nBe prepared to pay a filing fee. The filing fee for enforcement should be lower than the fee for an initial child support action. For example, in Harris County, the filing fee would be $31.00.In Tarrant County, the fee for an enforcement motion is $30.00., You must notify the other parent of the enforcement action. You can use the same method of service of process as you used in your initial support suit.\n The court will hold an enforcement hearing. Depending on the court, you may get the date of the hearing when you file, or it may be mailed to you. Arrive early and bring copies of your motion and all attachments.\n\n\nIf your motion was properly prepared with all attachments (history of payments and the original order), then the judge should have a good idea of how much money is owed by the non-custodial parent. Be prepared to affirm what you stated in your motion.\nIf the other parent doesn\u2019t attend, the court can issue an arrest warrant.\n Judges have several options for collecting arrearages. For example, a court can freeze bank accounts, offset state and federal income tax returns, place a lien on the non-custodial parent's property, and seize and sell property.A judge can also revoke state-issued licenses or jail the non-custodial parent for contempt. Think whether or not this is in your best interest. If the non-paying parent loses a license or is jailed, it will be harder for you to collect child support payments.","Contact the Attorney General, if necessary.\nGet an estimate of your support amount.\nConsider meeting with a lawyer.\nEstablish paternity.\nLocate the appropriate court.\nFind the correct petition form.\nGet other applicable forms.\nFill out the forms.\nSign the forms.\nFile the forms.\nServe the other parent.\nHire an attorney ad litem, if necessary.\nSend a copy to the state Attorney General.\nReceive payments.\nDraft a motion.\nContact the Texas Attorney General.\nFile the motion.\nServe notice.\nAttend a hearing.\nReceive payment.","How to File for Child Support in Texas"]]}
